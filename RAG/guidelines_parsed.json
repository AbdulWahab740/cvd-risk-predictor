For management of blood cholesterol, adults should be categorized as having \nlow (<5%), borderline (5% to <7.5%), intermedi-\nate (≥7.5% to <20%), or high (≥20%) 10-year risk.\nS2.2-4 The PCE are best validated among non-\nHispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks living in \nthe United States.S2.2-1,S2.2-39,S2.2-48,S2.2-49,S2.2-52 In other \nracial/ethnic groupsS2.2-53,S2.2-54 or in some non-\nUS populations,S2.2-40,S2.2-41,S2.2-53,S2.2-54 the PCE may \noverestimate or underestimate risk. Therefore, \nclinicians may consider the use of another risk \nprediction tool as an alternative to the PCE if the \ntool was validated in a population with charac-teristics similar to those of the evaluated patient. \nExamples include the general Framingham CVD \nrisk score,\nS2.2-55 the Reynolds risk scores,S2.2-56,S2.2-57 \nSCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation),S2.2-58 \nand the QRISK/JBS3S2.2-59 tools. Other professional \nsocieties have incorporated some of these alterna-\ntive validated risk scores into their lipid manage-\nment guidelines or have considered different risk thresholds for preventive interventions.\nS2.2-58–S2.2-63 \nAlthough slight differences exist across organi-\nzational guidelines, they are all very similar in \ntheir overarching goal of matching the intensity of preventive therapies to the absolute (generally 10-year) risk of the patient.\nS2.2-58–S2.2-63\n2. After age 20 years, it is reasonable to mea-sure traditional risk factors at least every 4 to  \n6 years.\nS2.2-1,S2.2-3 For adults 20 to 39 years of age, \nlimited data exist on the performance and utility of 10-year risk estimation tools.\nS2.2-64 Because age is \na major driver of risk, most in this age range (<40 \nyears) are unlikely to have a sufficiently elevated \n10-year risk to warrant pharmacological therapy with a statin (with some exceptions, such as in familial hypercholesterolemia). Nevertheless, peri-\nodic assessment of risk factors (eg, at least every \n4 to 6 years in younger adults 20 to 39 years of age) is important to guide discussions about inten-sity of lifestyle interventions, frequency of risk \nfactor monitoring, treatment of nonlipid risk fac-\ntors, and consideration of 30-year or lifetime risk \nestimation.\nS2.2-1–S2.2-3\n3. No single risk calculator is appropriate for all \npatients. In certain populations, the PCE have reasonable calibration.\nS2.2-1,S2.2-65–S2.2-67 However, \nsome studies have found underestimation of risk \n(and potential for undertreatment) among indi-\nviduals with chronic inflammatory conditions (eg, autoimmune disease,\nS2.2-50 HIV infectionS2.2-12) or \nsocioeconomic disadvantageS2.2-48,S2.2-49,S2.2-51 not Recommendations for Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk \n(Continued)\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nSeptember 10, 2019 Circulation. 2019;140:e596–e646.

Patients \nwith familial hypercholesterolemia are at signifi-\ncant risk of having an early ASCVD event, and the \nuse of risk calculators is not applicable to these \npatients. In contrast, other studies have found \noverestimation of risk with the PCE, particularly \namong those with higher socioeconomic posi-\ntion and those with continual access to care and preventive services, which could lead to overtreat-\nment of individuals less likely to receive net benefit \nfrom preventive pharmacotherapies over the next \ndecade.\nS2.2-15,S2.2-39–S2.2-47 The PCE may be subopti-\nmally calibrated in more modern populations as compared with the older cohorts from which they \nwere derived.\nS2.2-68 Therefore, among adults at bor -\nderline (5% to <7.5%) and intermediate (≥7.5% to \n<20%) risk, one may consider additional individual \nrisk-enhancing clinical factors (Table 3) that can be \nused to revise the 10-year ASCVD risk estimate.S2.2-4 \nThese factors may include having a family history \nof premature ASCVD,S2.2-5 chronic inflammatory \ndisease [rheumatoid arthritis,S2.2-6 lupus,S2.2-7 or HIV \ninfectionS2.2-12], South Asian ancestry,S2.2-13 a history \nof preeclampsiaS2.2-8 or preterm delivery,S2.2-9 early \nmenopause,S2.2-10 erectile dysfunction,S2.2-11 chronic \nkidney disease (CKD), metabolic syndrome, per -\nsistently elevated inflammatory markers,S2.2-14 or \nelevated lipid biomarkers.S2.2-4 After these clini-\ncally available risk-enhancing factors have been considered, if there is still uncertainty about \nthe reliability of the risk estimate for individu-als in the borderline- or intermediate-risk cat-\negories, further testing to document subclinical \ncoronary atherosclerosis is reasonable to more \naccurately reclassify the risk estimate upward or  \ndownward.\nS2.2-17–S2.2-19,S2.2-69\n4. For individuals with intermediate predicted risk (≥7.5% to <20%) by the PCE or for select adults \nwith borderline (5% to <7.5%) predicted risk, coronary artery calcium measurement can be a \nuseful tool in refining risk assessment for preven-\ntive interventions (eg, statin therapy).\nS2.2-4 In these \ngroups, coronary artery calcium measurement can reclassify risk upward (particularly if coronary artery calcium score is ≥100 Agatston units (AU) \nor ≥75th age/sex/race percentile) or downward \n(if coronary artery calcium is zero) in a signifi-\ncant proportion of individuals.\nS2.2-15 The extent of \nreclassification is sufficient to provide confidence \nthat borderline- or intermediate-risk patients \nwith elevated coronary artery calcium will have event rates that clearly exceed benefit thresholds \n(ie, ≥7.5% in 10 years) and those with coronary \nartery calcium scores of zero will have event rates \n<7.5%, which can help guide shared decision-making about statins\nS2.2-15,S2.2-16,S2.2-21 or potentially \neven aspirin.S2.2-70 In observational data, the pres-\nence and severity of coronary artery calcium have Table 3.

A \ncoronary artery calcium score of zero identifies indi-\nviduals at lower risk of ASCVD events and death \nover a ≥10-year period,S2.2-15,S2.2-17,S2.2-25 who appear \nto derive little or no benefit from statins for ASCVD risk reduction.\nS2.2-71 Thus, the absence of coronary \nartery calcium could reclassify a patient downward \ninto a lower risk group in which preventive interven-\ntions (eg, statins) could be postponed.S2.2-22 Note \nthat the absence of coronary artery calcium does not rule out noncalcified plaque, and clinical judg-\nment about risk should prevail. Coronary artery cal-\ncium might also be considered in refining risk for selected low-risk adults (<5% 10-year risk), such as those with a strong family history of premature \ncoronary heart disease (CHD).\nS2.2-23 MESAS2.2-28 and \nAstro-CHARM (Astronaut Cardiovascular Health \nand Risk Modification)S2.2-29 are risk estimation tools \nthat incorporate both risk factors and coronary \nartery calcium for estimating 10-year CHD and \nASCVD risk, respectively. Coronary artery calcium measurement is not intended as a “screening” test for all but rather may be used as a decision aid in \nselect adults to facilitate the clinician–patient risk \ndiscussion.\n5. For adults 20 to 39 years of age (who are not included in the PCE) and those 40 to 59 years \nof age who are not already at elevated (≥7.5%) \n10-year risk, estimating a lifetime or 30-year risk of ASCVD may be considered (ASCVD Risk Estimator).\nS2.2-2 Younger individuals often have low \nestimated 10-year risk, but the presence of at least 1 major risk factor by middle age is associated with increased lifetime ASCVD risk and reduced survival free of morbidity compared with those with opti-mal risk factors.\nS2.2-32–S2.2-34 Calculation of lifetime \nrisk with the ACC/AHA 30-year/lifetime risk esti-\nmator for those 20 to 59 years of age (not at high \nshort-term risk) may be reasonable to consider as a communication strategy for reinforcing adher -\nence to lifestyle recommendations.\nS2.2-23.

The cardiovascular nutri-\ntion literature is limited by the paucity of large-scale prospective randomized trials with ASCVD outcomes. \nAlthough RCTs focused on hard endpoints are limited, \nmultiple observational studies have focused on the association of CVD mortality with dietary patterns—\nspecifically, sugar, low-calorie sweeteners, high-carbo-\nhydrate diets, low-carbohydrate diets, refined grains, trans fat, saturated fat, sodium, red meat, and pro-\ncessed red meat (eg, bacon, salami, ham, hot dogs, \nsausage).\nS3.1-1–S3.1-24 Processed meats are any meat pre-\nserved by smoking, curing, or salting, or additional \nchemical preservatives.S3.1-28a\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1.

The PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) trial randomized participants to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with either extra-virgin olive oil or nuts and demonstrated 30% and 28% reductions, respectively, in the \ncombined endpoint (MI, stroke, or cardiovascular \nmortality), but the improved outcome was driven \nlargely by the reduction in stroke, with no signifi-\ncant improvement over the control diet for mor -\ntality or MI.\nS3.1-1 When the PREDIMED cohort was \nreanalyzed post hoc for the “provegetarian” food pattern (more vegetable consumption versus ani-\nmal, egg, fish, dairy, or meat product consump-\ntion), a significant mortality rate reduction (41%) was noted in the 2 quintiles with the highest \nvegetarian score.\nS3.1-11 A comparison of plant and \nanimal protein from the Adventist Health Study-2 \ncohortS3.1-10 similarly indicated that using meat for \nprotein was associated with a 61% increase in \nmortality rate, whereas replacing meat with nuts \nand seeds was associated with a 40% reduction in mortality rate. Similarly, the graded risk published by Song et al. indicated that lower mortality rate \nwas associated with replacing animal protein of \ndifferent origins with plant protein.\nS3.1-9 The evi-\ndence is mixed with regard to the effectiveness of dairy intake to reduce ASCVD risk factors, which \nis why it is not included in the listed foods for this \nrecommendation. Although the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which \nincludes low-fat dairy products, was shown to \nreduce BP ,\nS3.1-14 and the PURE (Prospective Urban \nRural Epidemiology) study indicated that dairy \nintake was associated with a 23% lower mortality \nrate,S3.1-31 Song et al. indicated an 11% increase in \ncardiovascular mortality rate with dairy consump-\ntion as compared with vegetable protein S3.1-9).\n2. Trans and saturated fats have been associated with \na higher risk of total and cause-specific death.S3.1-12 \nHowever, observational data from the PURE trial \nsuggested that, when used instead of refined car -\nbohydrates, saturated and unsaturated fats were \nassociated with reduced stroke and mortality.S3.1-13\n3. Dietary sodium reduction was found to reduce BP and cardiovascular events in the DASH trial and in TOHP (Trials of Hypertension Prevention).\nS3.1-14,S3.1-15 \nData from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys)\nS3.1-16 suggest that high con-\nsumption of sodium (>2000 mg daily), red meat \n(>14 g/d), and sugar-sweetened beverages and \nprocessed red meat consumption were associated with cardiovascular death. A prospective cohort study of US healthcare professionals\nS3.1-9 with at least 1 risk factor indicated that replacement of animal protein (sources of cholesterol, saturated fat, heme iron and precursors of trimethylamine-\nN-oxide) with plant protein was associated with \nreduced cardiovascular mortality rate. In that study, compared with plant protein, poultry and fish were \nassociated with a 6% higher mortality rate, dairy \nwith an 8% higher mortality rate, unprocessed red meat with a 12% higher mortality rate, eggs with a 19% higher mortality rate, and processed red \nmeat with a 34% higher mortality rate. Overall, \nplant protein was associated with a reduction in mortality rate of 10% for every 3% energy incre-ment replacement of animal protein.\n4. Intake of several food products has been shown to be potentially harmful or increase risk of ASCVD. Sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened bev-\nerages have been correlated with increasing the \ndevelopment of T2DM and with ASCVD risk, with a 20% increase in the frequency of diabetes mellitus with 1 daily serving of these sweetened \nbeverages.\nS3.1-18 In large cohort studies, consump-\ntion of added sugar at >10% of daily calories has been associated with increased mortality \nrate.\nS3.1-19 However, adults who are habitually \nhigh consumers of sugar-sweetened beverages \nand utilize low calorie sweetened beverages as a \nreplacement strategy that provides a sweet taste while reducing caloric intake may find this use-ful in the transition to water.\nS3.1-20 In REGARDS \n(REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences \nin Stroke),S3.1-21 the Southern dietary pattern was \nidentified as substantially increasing health risks, including a 56% higher risk of heart disease and \na 30% higher risk of stroke. This pattern con-sisted of more fried food, added fats, organ and processed meats, and sugar-sweetened bev-\nerages. Consuming a diet\nS3.1-4 with juices and \nsweetened beverages, refined grains, potatoes/fries, and sweets resulted in a greater increase \nin coronary events than the increase seen with consumption of animal products. Given the addi-tional risk associated with intake of these various \nfood products, clinicians would do well to coun-\nsel individuals about their associated harm and advise them to avoid these foods when possible. \nFurthermore, longstanding dietary patterns that \nfocus on low intake of carbohydrates and a high intake of animal fat and protein are associated with increased cardiac and noncardiac mortal-ity rate.\nS3.1-22–S3.1-24 In 1 meta-analysis,S3.1-23 low-\ncarbohydrate diets were associated with a 31% \nhigher risk of all-cause death, with increased \ncardiac mortality rate.

In addition, \nthe ARIC investigators noted a 23% increase in mortality rate associated with high-carbohydrate \ndiets, with the optimal carbohydrate intake \nobserved to be 50% to 55%.\n5. Intake of trans fat has been shown to be harm-ful and increase risk of ASCVD. Trans fat was \nassociated with higher all-cause mortality rate in \nthe REGARDS US healthcare professionals cohort studies.\nS3.1-12,S3.1-17 Additionally, regulations to \ncurb use of trans fat in the food industry have been associated with a decrease in stroke and MI.\nS3.1-25 Trans fats have adverse effects on lipid \nand lipoproteins and promote endothelial dys-function, insulin resistance, inflammation, and arrhythmias.\nS3.1-26 Since partially hydrogenated \noils are optional food additives, their elimination has been a public health priority.\nS3.1-27\n3.2.

These recommendations are in line with those of other health organizations.\nS3.2-26 \nShorter durations of exercise seem to be as ben-eficial as longer ones (eg, ≥10-minute bouts),\nS3.2-\n27,S3.2-28 and thus the focus of physical activity \ncounseling should be on the total accumulated amount. Additional reduction in ASCVD risk is seen in those achieving higher amounts of aero-bic physical activity (>300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aer -\nobic physical activity).\nS3.2-5,S3.2-6,S3.2-12,S3.2-14 There is \na continued but diminishing additive benefit of further increasing physical activity to very high levels.\nS3.2-5,S3.2-6,S3.2-12 Specific exercise recommen-\ndations for the prevention of heart failure may differ slightly because the dose–response rela-tionship with increasing physical activity levels may be linear.\nS3.2-29\n3. There is likely no lower limit on the quantity of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at which benefits for ASCVD risk start to accrue.\nS3.2-6 All \nefforts should be made to promote achievement of the minimum recommended amount of physi-cal activity by all adults. However, for individuals unable to achieve this minimum, encouraging at least some moderate-to-vigorous physical activity among those who are inactive (ie, no moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) or increasing the amount in those who are insufficiently active is still likely beneficial to reduce ASCVD risk.\nS3.2-6 \nStrategies to further increase physical activity in those achieving less than targeted amounts should be implemented.4. Despite the focus on moderate- and vigorous-\nintensity physical activity, such activity accounts for a small proportion of individuals’ daily time as compared with other forms of activity. Other activity states that comprise a 24-hour period for an average individual include sleep, light-intensity physical activity, and sedentary behavior (Figure 1). Sedentary behavior refers \nto waking behavior with an energy expenditure of ≤1.5 metabolic equivalents while in a sitting or reclining posture (Table 4).\nS3.2-30 Increased  \nsedentary behavior is associated with worse health parameters, including cardiometabolic risk  \nfactors.\nS3.2-3,S3.2-9–S3.2-11 Sedentary behavior may \nbe most deleterious to ASCVD risk for individu-als who engage in the least amount of moder -\nate to vigorous physical activity.\nS3.2-3,S3.2-10,S3.2-12 \nThus, strategies to reduce sedentary behavior, particularly in those not achieving current rec-ommended physical activity levels, may be ben-eficial for lowering ASCVD risk. However, data on the value of reducing or modifying sedentary behavior over time to reduce ASCVD risk are sparse, and whether replacing sedentary behav-ior with light-intensity activity (eg, slow walking, light work) is beneficial for ASCVD prevention is unclear.\nS3.2-31 The strength and specificity of the \nrecommendation to reduce sedentary behavior are limited by uncertainty about the appropriate limits of and optimal approach to modifying sed-entary behavior.\nS3.2-30Figure 1. Hours per day spent in various states of activity. \nUS adults spend >7 h/d on average in sedentary activities.

Calculating body mass index (BMI) is \nrecommended annually or more frequently \nto identify adults with overweight and \nobesity for weight loss considerations.\nIIa B-NR4.  It is reasonable to measure waist circumference to identify those at higher \ncardiometabolic risk.\nS4.1-3–S4.1-6\nSynopsis\nThe increased availability of affordable, palatable, and \nhigh-calorie foods and the decreased physical de-mands of many jobs have fueled the epidemic of obe-sity and the consequent increases in hypertension and T2DM.\nS4.1-7 Adults diagnosed as obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) \nor overweight (BMI=25 to 29.9 kg/m2) are at increased \nrisk of ASCVD, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, com-pared with those of a normal weight.\nS4.1-8,S4.1-9 The nu-\ntritional aspects of obesity revolve around the principle of balancing caloric intake with caloric expenditure. Following the 2013 Guideline for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adults from the AHA, ACC, and The Obesity Society (TOS), adults with overweight/obesity are advised to participate in comprehensive life-style programs of ≥6 months’ duration that assist par -\nticipants in adhering to a low-calorie diet (800 to 1500 kcal/day) and increased physical activity. Existing clinical guidance strongly recommends face-to-face or tele-phone-delivered weight-loss maintenance programs that provide regular contact (at least monthly) with a trained interventionist to help participants engage in high levels of physical activity (200 to 300 minutes/week), monitor body weight regularly (at least weekly), and consume a reduced-calorie diet.\nS4.1-10\nUS Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved \npharmacological therapiesS4.1-1,S4.1-11 and bariatric \nsurgery,S4.1-12 adjunctive to complementary lifestyle in-\nterventions, additionally reduce weight and may have \na role in weight loss for select patients. The present \nguideline document focuses primarily on lifestyle inter -\nventions for overweight and obesity, as outlined in the 2013 AHA/ACC/TOS Guideline for the Management \nof Overweight and Obesity in Adults.S4.1-10 Weight loss \ninterventions should be cautiously implemented and \nindividualized, especially in older adults, to avoid det-\nrimental effects, such as loss of lean body/muscle mass and nutritional deficiencies.\nS4.1-13–S4.1-15\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. Clinically meaningful weight loss (≥5% initial \nweight) is associated with moderate improvement \nin BP , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride, and glucose levels among individuals \nwith overweight/obesity.\nS4.1-1 Weight loss reduces or \ndelays the development of T2DM in persons with obesity.\nS4.1-1,S4.1-16,S4.1-17 High-intensity (≥14 sessions \nin 6 months) comprehensive weight-loss interven-tions provided by a trained interventionist work \nbest.\nS4.1-10 However, other modalities, such as elec-\ntronically delivered weight-loss programs with per -\nsonalized feedback and some commercial-based programs, have also shown moderate results.\n2. Comprehensive lifestyle intervention consists of a structured program, which includes regular self-monitoring of food intake, physical activity, and weight. Increased physical activity, preferably aerobic \nphysical activity (eg, brisk walking) for ≥150 minutes/\nweek (equal to ≥30 minutes/day on most days of the \nweek), is recommended for initial weight loss.\nS4.1-10 \nHigher levels of physical activity, approximately 200 to 300 minutes/week, are recommended to main-\ntain weight loss or minimize weight regain after 1 year. Adults with obesity are also typically prescribed a diet designed to reduce caloric intake by ≥500 kcal/\nday from baseline, which often can be attained by \nlimiting women to 1200 to 1500 kcal/day and men \nto 1500 to 1800 kcal/day.\nS4.1-10 A very-low-calorie \ndiet (defined as <800 kcal/day) should be prescribed only in limited circumstances and only by trained \nclinicians in a medical care setting with the patient under medical supervision.\nS4.1-10 Comprehensive life-\nstyle intervention has been shown to produce on average 8 kg of weight loss (5% to 10% of initial body weight) in the short term (≤6 months) and intermediate term (6 to 12 months), compared with \nusual care.\nS4.1-1,S4.1-10 However, longer interventions \nafter 1 year are associated with gradual weight gain of 1 or 2 kg/year (on average), compared with usual \ncare. Weight loss of 5% to 10% of initial weight, achieved through comprehensive lifestyle interven-\ntion, has been shown to improve BP , delay the onset \nof T2DM, improve glycemic control in T2DM, and improve lipid profile.\nS4.1-1,S4.1-2\n3.

A USPSTF document found good evi-dence supporting the use of BMI to identify adults at \nincreased risk of future morbidity and mortality.\nS4.1-18 \nBecause obesity/overweight defined by BMI is the \nmost studied and standardized approach, we rec-ommend its measurement for primary screening of \nindividuals needing weight loss.

Thus, combining waist circumference \nand BMI may be the best approach for assessing \nobesity-related risk. Counseling and comprehensive \nlifestyle interventions, including calorie restriction \nand adjunctive therapies (eg, FDA–approved drugs, \nbariatric surgery), have all been associated with significant reductions in waist circumference and \nimprovement in cardiometabolic risk profiles.\nS4.1-1\n4.2.

For all adults with T2DM, a tailored nutrition plan focusing on a heart-healthy dietary \npattern is recommended to improve \nglycemic control, achieve weight loss if \nneeded, and improve other ASCVD risk \nfactors.\nS4.2-1,S4.2-2I A2.  Adults with T2DM should perform at least \n150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity \nphysical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-\nintensity physical activity to improve glycemic \ncontrol, achieve weight loss if needed, and \nimprove other ASCVD risk factors.S4.2-3,S4.2-4\nIIa B-R3.  For adults with T2DM, it is reasonable to initiate metformin as first-line therapy \nalong with lifestyle therapies at the time of diagnosis to improve glycemic control and \nreduce ASCVD risk.\nS4.2-5–S4.2-8\nIIb B-R4.  For adults with T2DM and additional ASCVD risk factors who require glucose-lowering \ntherapy despite initial lifestyle modifications \nand metformin, it may be reasonable to \ninitiate a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like \npeptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist to \nimprove glycemic control and reduce CVD \nrisk.\nS4.2-9–S4.2-14\nSynopsis\nT2DM, defined as a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >6.5%, is \na metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance leading to hyperglycemia. Unlike type 1 diabetes mellitus (an autoimmune condition largely unrelated to lifestyle \nfactors), the development and progression of T2DM are \nheavily influenced by dietary pattern, physical activity, and body weight. Approximately 12% of US adults have diabetes, 90% to 95% of whom have T2DM, with sig-nificant heterogeneity according to age, sex, race/eth-nicity, and socioeconomic status.\nS4.2-15 Alarmingly, more \nthan one-third of US adults (≈80 million adults) have prediabetes and are at risk of developing T2DM.\nS4.2-15*\nAlthough contemporary data have shown a sig-\nnificant decrease in ASCVD rates in individuals with T2DM,\nS4.2-15 T2DM remains a highly prevalent disease \nand a major ASCVD risk factor. An aggressive, com-prehensive approach to ASCVD risk factor treatment in adults with T2DM reduces ASCVD events.\nS4.2-16 Man-\nagement of cholesterol and hypertension in adults with T2DM is discussed in the relevant sections of the pres-\nent guideline (see Sections 4.3. and 4.4.).\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1.

Establishing an appropriate nutrition plan requires time and effort and is best accomplished with assistance from a registered dietitian-nutri-tionist or a diabetes education program.\n2. Initiation of an exercise program for those with T2DM has been shown to improve glycemic control, with a prior meta-analysis showing a significant reduction in mean HbA1c (7.65% ver -\nsus 8.31%) in individuals assigned to an exercise program versus control groups.\nS4.2-22 The com-\nbination of aerobic and resistance training fur -\nther improves glycemic control and facilitates weight loss more than either type of exercise  \nalone.\nS4.2-3,S4.2-4 Prospective cohort studies have pro-\nvided supportive data for the benefits of physical activity in individuals with T2DM, with increased levels of physical activity associated with lower rates of CVD events and CVD death.\nS4.2-17\nHow to best promote physical activity in indi-\nviduals with T2DM remains unclear. For older indi-viduals with other comorbidities, a simple walking program may be ideal, whereas for younger, healthier individuals, a variety of activities should be encouraged. In addition to a structured exer -\ncise program, a general increase in physical activity throughout the day (eg, taking the stairs, walking or biking to work, avoiding prolonged periods of sitting) should be encouraged.\n3.

In a substudy of the UKPDS (United \nKingdom Prospective Diabetes Study), metformin, \ncompared with conventional therapy (ie, lifestyle \nmodifications alone), resulted in a 32% reduc-tion in microvascular and macrovascular diabetes-related outcomes, a 39% reduction in MI, and a \n36% reduction in all-cause mortality rate.\nS4.2-5 A \n2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of glu-\ncose-lowering therapies for T2DM supported the use of metformin as first-line therapy for T2DM \nbecause of its beneficial effects on HbA1c, weight, \nand improved ASCVD outcomes (compared with sulfonylureas), as well as its acceptable safety pro-file and low cost. However, a separate systematic \nreview found no evidence of reduced CVD events \nor CVD deaths with metformin.\nS4.2-8 Metformin \ncarries a small risk of lactic acidosis and must be used with caution in patients with CKD. For \nyounger individuals or those with a mildly elevated \nHbA1c at the time of diagnosis of T2DM, clinicians can consider a trial of lifestyle therapies for 3 to 6 \nmonths before reconsideration of metformin.\n4. Several classes of medications have been shown to \neffectively lower blood glucose but may or may not affect ASCVD risk.\nS4.2-23–S4.2-26 However, 2 classes of \nglucose-lowering medications have recently been demonstrated to reduce CVD events in adults with \nT2DM and high ASCVD risk. SGLT-2 inhibitors act \nin the proximal tubule to increase urinary excre-tion of glucose and sodium, leading to a reduction in HbA1c, body weight, and BP . Three RCTs have shown a significant reduction in ASCVD events and \nheart failure with use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor.\nS4.2-9,S4.2-10,  \nS4.2-12 Although most patients studied had estab-\nlished CVD at baseline, the reduction in heart failure \nhas been shown to extend to primary prevention \npopulations.S4.2-12,S4.2-27 The GLP-1R agonists increase \ninsulin and glucagon production in the liver, increase \nglucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue, and \ndecrease hepatic glucose production. Three GLP-1R \nagonists have been found to significantly reduce the risk of ASCVD in adults with T2DM who are at high ASCVD risk.\nS4.2-11,S4.2-13,S4.2-14 As opposed to a reduc-\ntion in heart failure with SGLT-2 inhibitors, the ben-\nefit of the GLP-1R agonists has been a reduction in \nASCVD events though the majority of patients stud-\nied had established CVD.\nIn patients with T2DM and additional risk fac-\ntors for CVD, it may be reasonable to initiate these 2 \nclasses of medications for primary prevention of CVD.\n4.3.

Most patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabe-tes are at intermediate or high risk (PCE ≥7.5% 10-year risk) of ASCVD events.\nS4.3-15,S4.3-16,S4.3-18 \nThree of 4 double-blinded primary-prevention RCTs of moderate statin therapy in large cohorts with diabetes in this age range showed significant reductions in ASCVD events.\nS4.3-11,S4.3-12,S4.3-14,S4.3-17 A \nmeta-analysis of these trials found that moderate-intensity statin therapy was associated with a risk reduction of 25%,\nS4.3-13 similar to people without \ndiabetes and with no apparent difference in ben-efit between type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM. Therefore, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated for primary prevention in patients 40 to \n75 years of age with diabetes.\n4. Patients with primary severe hypercholesterolemia \n(LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL [≥4.9 mmol/L]) have a high \nrisk of ASCVD\nS4.3-23 and premature and recurrent \ncoronary events. Although no randomized, pla-cebo-controlled trials of statin therapy have been \ndone exclusively in subjects with LDL-C ≥190 mg/\ndL, a placebo-controlled primary-prevention study performed in men with a mean baseline LDL-C \nof 192 ± 17 mg/dL demonstrated a reduced inci-\ndence of MI and cardiovascular death in those receiving pravastatin 40 mg daily.\nS4.3-24 These find-\nings were extended in a post hoc analysis of 2 560 exclusively primary-prevention subjects in \nthat RCT and in a 20-year observational post-trial \nlong-term follow-up study.\nS4.3-37 Because moder -\nate- or high-intensity statins have been shown to reduce ASCVD risk and because high-intensity statins provide greater ASCVD risk reduction than do moderate-intensity statins or placebo,\nS4.3-2 \nmaximally tolerated statin therapy should be \nadministered to patients with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL. \nPlease refer to the 2018 cholesterol guidelineS4.3-1 \nfor recommendations on the use of non-statin therapies in these patients.\n5. The occurrence of a first ASCVD event in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes is associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared with those without diabetes, which places a partic-\nularly high premium on primary prevention in indi-\nviduals with diabetes in that age range. Although trials using moderate-intensity statin therapy have \ndemonstrated significant benefit in such indi-\nviduals, the residual risk in the statin treatment groups in these trials remained high. (eg, 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in 3.8 years).\nS4.3-13 \nThe benefit from statin therapy is related to both global risk and intensity of treatment,\nS4.3-2 and no \nRCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have been \ncarried out in cohorts of patients exclusively with \ndiabetes. On the basis of these considerations and the fact that patients with diabetes have a higher trajectory of lifetime risk than do those without \ndiabetes, high-intensity statin therapy is preferred \nin patients with diabetes as they develop risk \nmodifiers (Table 5).\n6.

Lipoprotein (a) levels, especially in those with a family history of pre-\nmature ASCVD, can increase risk.\nS4.3-27 However, \nno available RCT evidence supports lipoprotein (a) \nlevels as a target of therapy. Moderate primary \nelevations of triglycerides, non–HDL-C (total cho-\nlesterol – HDL-C), and, if measured, apolipopro-tein B can improve selection of those at increased ASCVD risk.\nS4.3-33\n7. In adults at intermediate risk, coronary artery calcium measurement can be effective for mean-ingfully reclassifying risk in a large proportion of individuals.\nS4.3-41–S4.3-55 In such intermediate-risk \nadults, those with coronary artery calcium ≥100 AU or coronary artery calcium ≥75th percentile \nhave ASCVD event rates for which initiation of \nstatin therapy is reasonable.\nS4.3-41 Those with \ncoronary artery calcium scores of zero appear to have 10-year event rates in a lower range for which statin therapy may be of limited value. For those with coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 99 AU, 10-year ASCVD event rates are \n3.8%, 6.5%, and 8.3% for adults 45 to 54, 55 to \n64, and 65 to 74 years of age, respectively,\nS4.3-34 \nindicating that risk reclassification is modest for individuals with coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 99. Therefore, for patients with coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 99, it is reasonable to repeat the risk discussion. If these patients \nremain untreated, repeat coronary artery calcium \nmeasurement in 5 years may have some value, but data are limited.\nS4.3-56,S4.3-57 Selected examples \nof candidates who might benefit from knowing that their coronary artery calcium scores are zero \nare listed in Table 6. Clinicians should not down-classify risk in patients who have coronary artery calcium scores of zero but who are persistent cigarette smokers, have diabetes, have a fam-ily history of ASCVD, or, possibly, have chronic inflammatory conditions. In the presence of these conditions, a coronary artery calcium of zero does not rule out risk from noncalcified plaque or increased risk of thrombosis.\nS4.3-58\n8. Benefit from statin therapy is also seen in lower-risk individuals.\nS4.3-35 For those in the 5% to \n<7.5% risk range, available generic statins are cost-effective.\nS4.3-59 Nonetheless, the challenge \namong those in a lower ASCVD risk category is to include those who would benefit, yet avoid casting too wide a net, to minimize treat-ing those who would derive little benefit from statins. This risk group benefits greatly from a clinician–patient risk discussion. Clinicians should assess priorities for health care, perceived ASCVD risk, and prior risk reduction experiences and should use best practices for communicat-ing risk to arrive at a shared risk decision. The presence of risk-enhancing factors is probably the best indicator favoring initiation of statin therapy (Table 3 in",

An increased risk of ASCVD associated with \nhigher SBP and DBP has been reported across a broad \nage spectrum, from 30 to >80 years of age. Although \nthe relative risk of incident CVD associated with higher SBP and DBP is smaller at older ages, the correspond-ing high BP-related increase in absolute risk is larger in \nolder persons (≥65 years) given the higher absolute risk \nof CVD at an older age.\nS4.4-55 See Figure 4 for the BP \nthresholds and treatment recommendations algorithm and refer to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines for comprehensive details.\nS4.4-1\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1.

Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of trials that \ncompare more intensive BP reduction to standard BP \nreduction report that more intense BP lowering sig-nificantly reduces the risk of stroke, coronary events, \nmajor cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular \nmortality.\nS4.4-33,S4.4-39,S4.4-47,S4.4-71 Achieving an addi-\ntional 10–mm Hg reduction in SBP reduced CVD risk when compared with an average BP of 158/82 \nto 143/76 mm Hg, 144/85 to 137/81 mm Hg, and \n134/79 to 125/76 mm Hg. Patients with diabetes mellitus and CKD were included in the analyses.\nS4.4-39\n4. Most patients with CKD have a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥10%, requiring initiation of antihypertensive \ndrug therapy at BP ≥130/80 mm Hg. In SPRINT, the \nparticipants with CKD who were randomized to intensive therapy (SBP target <120 mm Hg) derived the same beneficial reduction in CVD events and \nall-cause mortality that was seen among in their \ncounterparts without CKD, with no difference seen in the principal renal outcome.\nS4.4-34 Other \nRCTsS4.4-43,S4.4-44 that evaluated the effect of differ -\ning BP goals on CKD progression in patients with \nCKD demonstrated no benefit for more intensive \nBP reduction, although post hoc follow-up analy-ses favored lower targets in patients with more severe proteinuria.\nS4.4-72 These trials were under -\npowered to detect differences in CVD event rates. Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews \nsupport more intensive BP treatment to reduce \ncardiovascular events but do not demonstrate a reduction in the rate of progression of kidney \ndisease.\nS4.4-31,S4.4-33,S4.4-39 More intensive BP treat-\nment may result in a modest reduction in glomeru-\nlar filtration rate, which is thought to be primarily \nattributable to a hemodynamic effect and may be \nreversible. Electrolyte abnormalities are also more likely during intensive BP treatment.\n5. Most adults with diabetes mellitus a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥10%, requiring initiation of antihy-pertensive drug therapy at BP ≥130/80 mm Hg and a treatment goal of <130/80 mm Hg.\nS4.4-73 \nSeveral meta-analyses of RCTs included all trials with a difference in BP levels\nS4.4-31,S4.4-71 and sup-\nported lowering BP to <130/80 mm Hg among \nthose with diabetes mellitus. Two meta-analyses \naddressing target BP in adults with diabetes mel-litus restricted the analysis to RCTs that random-ized patients to different BP levels.\nS4.4-33,S4.4-47 Target \nBP of 133/76 mm Hg provided significant benefit compared with that of 140/81 mm Hg for major \ncardiovascular events, MI, stroke, albuminuria, \nand retinopathy progression.\nS4.4-33\nIn the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardio-\nvascular Risk in Diabetes) trial,S4.4-51 lowering the BP target (SBP <120 mm Hg) did not reduce the \nrate of the composite outcome of fatal and non-\nfatal major cardiovascular events and was asso-\nciated with greater risk of adverse events, such as self-reported hypotension and a reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Secondary analyses of the ACCORD trial demonstrated a sig-nificant outcome benefit of stroke risk reduction \nin the intensive BP/standard glycemic group.\nS4.4-74\n6. The relationship of SBP with CVD risk is continuous \nacross levels of SBP and similar across groups that differ in level of absolute risk.\nS4.4-55 The relative risk \nreduction attributable to BP-lowering medication therapy is consistent across the range of absolute risk observed in trials,\nS4.4-36 suggesting that rela-\ntive risk reduction may be similar at lower levels of absolute risk. Indirect support is also provided \nby evidence from trials using BP-lowering medica-\ntions to reduce the risk of developing higher levels of BP .\nS4.4-75,S4.4-76 In the HOPE-3 (Heart Outcomes \nPrevention Evaluation-3) BP Trial, there was no evidence of short-term benefit during treatment of adults (average age 66 years) with a relatively \nlow risk of CVD (3.8% CVD event rate during 5.6 \nyears of follow-up). However, subgroup analysis suggested benefit in those with an average SBP >140 mm Hg (and a CVD risk of 6.5% during the \n5.6 years of follow-up).\nS4.4-59\n7. The treatment of patients with hypertension with-\nout elevated risk has been systematically under -\nstudied because lower-risk groups would require \nprolonged follow-up to have a sufficient number \nof clinical events to provide useful outcomes data. Although there is clinical trial evidence that both drug and nondrug therapy will interrupt the pro-gressive course of hypertension, there is no trial evi-\ndence that this treatment decreases CVD morbidity \nand mortality. The clinical trial evidence is strongest for a target BP of 140/90 mm Hg in this population. However, observational studies suggest that these \nindividuals often have a high lifetime risk and would \nbenefit from BP control earlier in life.\nS4.4-77\n4.5.

In adults who use tobacco, a combination \nof behavioral interventions plus \npharmacotherapy is recommended to \nmaximize quit rates.S4.5-2,S4.5-3\nI B-NR4.  In adults who use tobacco, tobacco abstinence is recommended to reduce ASCVD risk.\nS4.5-4,S4.5-5\nIIa B-R5.  To facilitate tobacco cessation, it is reasonable to dedicate trained staff to \ntobacco treatment in every healthcare \nsystem.\nS4.5-1\nIII: Harm B-NR6.  All adults and adolescents should avoid secondhand smoke exposure to reduce ASCVD risk.\nS4.5-6\nSynopsis\nTobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, \ndisability, and death in the United States.S4.5-7 Smoking \nand smokeless tobacco (eg, chewing tobacco) use in-\ncreases the risk of all-cause mortality and is a cause \nof ASCVD.S4.5-4,S4.5-5 Secondhand smoke is a cause of \nASCVD and stroke,S4.5-6 and almost one-third of CHD \ndeaths are attributable to smoking and exposure to \nsecondhand smoke. Even low levels of smoking in-\ncrease risks of acute MI; thus, reducing the number of cigarettes per day does not totally eliminate risk.\nS4.5-8 \nHealthy People 2020 recommends that cessation treat-\nment in clinical care settings be expanded, with access \nto proven cessation treatment provided to all tobacco users.\nS4.5-9 Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), \noften called e-cigarettes,S4.5-10 are a new class of tobacco \nproduct that emit aerosol containing fine and ultrafine \nparticulates, nicotine, and toxic gases that may increase \nrisk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases.S4.5-11 Ar-\nrhythmias and hypertension with e-cigarette use have also been reported.\nS4.5-12 Chronic use is associated with \npersistent increases in oxidative stress and sympathetic \nstimulation in young, healthy subjects.S4.5-13\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. On the basis of on the US Public Health Service’s \nClinical Practice Guideline for Treating Tobacco \nUse and Dependence,S4.5-14,S4.5-15 the USPSTF rec-\nommended (Grade A) in 2003 and reaffirmed in \n2009 that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco \nuse.S4.5-2 Treating tobacco use status as a vital sign \nand recording tobacco use status in the health \nrecord at every healthcare visit not only increases \nthe rate of tobacco treatment but also improves \ntobacco abstinence.S4.5-15,S4.5-16 Office-wide screen-\ning systems (eg, chart stickers, computer prompts) that expand the vital signs to include tobacco use status (current, former, never) can facilitate \ntobacco cessation.\nS4.5-15 Because many people who \nuse tobacco do not report it, using multiple ques-tions to assess tobacco use status may improve \naccuracy and disclosure. For example, clinicians \nshould ask, “Have you smoked any tobacco prod-\nuct in the past 30 days, even a puff?” “Have you vaped or ‘juuled’ in the past 30 days, even a puff?” \n“Have you used any other tobacco product in the \npast 30 days?” If these questions are answered with “yes,” the patient is considered a current \nsmoker. Clinicians should avoid asking “Are you \na smoker?” or “Do you smoke?” because people \nare less likely to report tobacco use when asked in \nthis way.\nS4.5-17\n2. Tobacco users are more likely to quit after 6 \nmonths when clinicians strongly advise adults to \nquit using tobacco than when clinicians give no advice or usual care.\nS4.5-2 To help patients quit, it \nis critically important to use language that is clear \nand strong, yet compassionate, nonjudgmental, \nand personalized, to urge every tobacco user to \nquit.S4.5-15 For example, “The most important thing \nyou can do for your health is to quit tobacco use. I (we) can help.” The ASCVD benefits of quitting \nare immediate.\nS4.5-18 The best and most effective \ntreatments are those that are acceptable to and \nfeasible for an individual patient; clinicians should \nconsider the patient’s specific medical history and \npreferences and offer to provide tailored strategies \nthat work best for the patient.S4.5-3,S4.5-19\n3. In alignment with previous expert consensus regarding strategies for tobacco cessation,\nS4.5-19 \nTable 8 summarizes recommended behavioral \ninterventions and pharmacotherapy for tobacco \ntreatment. There are 7 FDA-approved cessation \nmedications, including 5 forms of nicotine replace-\nment. Note that the black box warnings about \nneuropsychiatric events have been removed by the \nFDA.S4.5-20,4.5-21 The net benefit of FDA-approved \ntobacco-cessation pharmacotherapy and behav-ioral interventions (even just 3 minutes of practical \nadvice), alone or combined, in nonpregnant adults \n(≥18 years of age) who smoke is substantial. The \nnet benefit of behavioral interventions for tobacco cessation on perinatal outcomes and smoking \nabstinence in pregnant women who smoke is \nsubstantial. However, the evidence on pharmaco-therapy for tobacco cessation in pregnant women \nis insufficient; the balance of benefits and harms \ncannot be determined. Among hospitalized adults \nwho use tobacco, intensive counseling with con-\ntinued supportive follow-up contacts for at least one month after discharge is recommended.\nS4.5-22\nENDS are not recommended as a tobacco \ntreatment method. The evidence is unclear about Recommendations for Treatment of Tobacco Use (Continued)\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nSeptember 10, 2019 Circulation. 2019;140:e596–e646.

The evidence on the use of ENDS as a smok-ing-cessation tool in adults (including pregnant women) and adolescents is insufficient\nS4.5-23 or \nlimited.S4.5-24 The USPSTF recommends that clini-\ncians direct patients who smoke tobacco to other cessation interventions with established effective-ness and safety.\n4. Cigarette smoking remains a strong, indepen-dent risk factor for ASCVD events and premature death.\nS4.5-4 Even among older adults, tobacco ces-\nsation is beneficial in reducing excess risk.S4.5-5 \nThe risk of heart failure and death for most for -\nmer smokers is similar to that of never smokers after >15 years of tobacco cessation.\nS4.5-25 In the \nNational Health Interview Survey, smoking was strongly associated with ASCVD in young people after adjustment for multiple risk factors,\nS4.5-26 \nwhich is why abstinence from an early age is recommended.5. Tobacco use dependence is a chronic disease  \nthat requires highly skilled chronic disease man-agement. It is a reasonable expectation that every health system or practice should dedicate trained staff to tobacco treatment. Healthcare profes-sionals who receive training in tobacco treatment are more likely to ask about tobacco use, offer advice to quit, provide behavioral interventions, follow up with individuals, and increase the num-\nber of tobacco users who quit.\nS4.5-1 Participants \nwho earn a certificate in tobacco treatment \npractice demonstrate a nationally recognized level of training and skill acquisition in treating tobacco dependence.\ns4.5-27 A Tobacco Treatment \nSpecialist is a professional who possesses the skills, knowledge, and training to provide effec-tive, evidence-based interventions for tobacco dependence across a range of intensities.\nS4.5-28 \nA list of accredited Tobacco Treatment Specialist programs is available here: http://ctttp.org/accredited-programs.\nS4.5-29Table 8.

Secondhand smoke exposure is known to cause \nCVDS4.5-6 and strokeS4.5-16 in nonsmokers, and it \ncan lead to immediate adverse events.S4.5-30 There \nis no safe lower limit of exposure to secondhand \nsmoke.S4.5-31 Even brief exposure to secondhand \nsmoke can trigger an MI.S4.5-30,S4.5-32 Even though \nexposure to secondhand smoke has steadily decreased over time, certain subgroups remain \nexposed to secondhand smoke in homes, vehicles, \npublic places, and workplaces. It is estimated that \n41 000 preventable deaths per year occur in adult \nnonsmokers as a result of exposure to second-hand smoke.\nS4.5-33 The US Department of Housing \nand Urban Development prohibited the use of \ncombustible tobacco products in all public hous-\ning living units, indoor common areas, and public \nhousing agency administrative office buildings, \nextending to all outdoor areas up to 25 feet from public housing buildings.\nS4.5-34 Therefore, the pres-\nent writing committee recommends that clinicians \nadvise patients to take precautions against expo-\nsure to secondhand smoke and aerosol from all \ntobacco products, such as by instituting smoking \nrestrictions (including ENDS) inside all homes and \nvehicles and within 25 feet from all entryways, \nwindows, and building vents.\n4.6. Aspirin Use\nRecommendations for Aspirin Use\nReferenced studies that support recommendations are summarized \nin Online Data Supplements 17 and 18.\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nIIb A1.  Low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg orally daily) might be considered for the primary \nprevention of ASCVD among select adults \n40 to 70 years of age who are at higher \nASCVD risk but not at increased bleeding \nrisk.\nS4.6-1–S4.6-8\nIII: Harm B-R2.  Low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg orally daily) should not be administered on a routine \nbasis for the primary prevention of ASCVD \namong adults >70 years of age.\nS4.6-9\nIII: Harm C-LD3.  Low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg orally daily) \nshould not be administered for the primary \nprevention of ASCVD among adults of any age who are at increased risk of \nbleeding.\nS4.6-10\nSynopsis\nFor decades, aspirin has been widely administered for \nASCVD prevention. By irreversibly inhibiting platelet \nfunction, aspirin reduces risk of atherothrombosis but \nalso increases risk of bleeding, particularly in the gas-\ntrointestinal tract.S4.6-11 Aspirin is well established for \nsecondary prevention of ASCVDS4.6-12 and is widely rec-\nommended for this indication.S4.6-13 However, in primary \nprevention, aspirin use is more controversial. Because persons without prior ASCVD are inherently less likely \nto have future ASCVD events than are those with a prior history, it is more challenging for clinicians and \npatients to balance benefits and harms of prophylactic \naspirin for primary prevention. This uncertainty is re-flected in international guidelines, where, for example, aspirin is not recommended in European guidelines for \nprimary ASCVD prevention\nS4.6-13 but is recommended in \nprior US guidelines for selected primary prevention for adults who have elevated risk of ASCVD based on tradi-\ntional risk factors.\nS4.6-14,S4.6-15 Adding to this controversy  \nare more recently conducted primary-prevention trials  \nthat, in contrast to older trials,S4.6-12 have shown less \noverall benefit of prophylactic aspirin alongside coad-\nministration of contemporary ASCVD preventive treat-\nments, such as evidence-based hypertension and cho-lesterol therapies.\nS4.6-5–S4.6-9,S4.6-16,S4.6-17\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. To balance the benefits and risks, prior US guide-\nlines have recommended prophylactic aspirin \nonly in the setting of elevated ASCVD risk (eg, \nas calculated by risk estimators like the PCE or based on the presence of specific ASCVD risk  \nfactors).\nS4.6-14,S4.6-18 Meta-regression analyses of his-\ntorical trials show that observed ASCVD risk tracks \nreasonably well with baseline-estimated ASCVD \nrisk.S4.6-19 In contrast, observed bleeding risk on \naspirin is less well correlated with baseline-esti-\nmated ASCVD risk.S4.6-19 (A nonexhaustive list of \nscenarios associated with increased risk of bleed-ing includes: a history of previous gastrointestinal \nbleeding or peptic ulcer disease or bleeding from other sites, age >70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, CKD, and concurrent use of other \nmedications that increase bleeding risk, such as \nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, \ndirect oral anticoagulants, and warfarin.) In this \ncontext, post hoc study of older trials suggests that the benefit–risk ratio for prophylactic aspirin \ngenerally becomes more favorable at >10% esti-\nmated 10-year ASCVD risk.\nS4.6-15,S4.6-19 However, \nthe relative benefits of aspirin, specifically in pre-venting nonfatal MI and perhaps stroke (with a trend to lower mortality) have been less evident in more recent trials.\nS4.6-9,S4.6-16,S4.6-17,S4.6-20 Similarly, in \nthese recent trials, the estimated ASCVD risk has generally exceeded the actual risk observed during follow-up.\nS4.6-17 These recent data are the rationale \nfor the lower COR for prophylactic aspirin in the present guideline (Class IIb) and the removal of a specific PCE risk threshold as an inclusion criterion for aspirin consideration. These changes reflect the \nneed to instead consider the totality of available \nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nArnett et al 2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease\nSeptember 10, 2019 Circulation. 2019;140:e596–e646. DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000678\n e622\nCLINICAL STATEMENTS  \nAND GUIDELINESevidence for ASCVD risk [inclusive, where appro-\npriate, of risk-enhancing factors, such as strong family history of premature MI, inability to achieve \nlipid or BP or glucose targets, or significant eleva-\ntion in coronary artery calcium score\nS4.6-21] and to \nalso tailor decisions about prophylactic aspirin to patient and clinician preferences. Depending on \nrisk factors present, a given patient and his/her \nclinician may decide that lowering the risk of MI (which has potentially serious long-term conse-\nquences not captured by clinical trials of 5 to 10 \nyears’ duration) is worth a slight excess risk of seri-ous bleeding. Recent trials show that absolute risk for ASCVD events typically exceeds that of bleed-ing and, although the gap of relative benefit to \nrelative harm for aspirin has narrowed, the num-\nber needed to treat to prevent an ASCVD event remains lower than the number needed to harm \nto cause bleeding. Others may feel that the ben-\nefit of prophylactic aspirin is comparable to the risk and may instead choose to focus on optimal control of other modifiable ASCVD risk factors. \nTherefore, a Class IIb recommendation remains \nmore suitable than a Class III recommendation for adults 40 to 70 years of age. Given the nar -\nrow overall balance between benefits and harms \nof prophylactic aspirin, there is limited justifica-\ntion to use aspirin at doses >100 mg daily for pri-mary prevention. Indeed, meta-analyses suggest that the ASCVD risk benefit for low-dose aspirin \nis equivalent to that for high-dose aspirin, but \nthe bleeding risk is higher with high-dose aspi-rin. Recent observational studies motivate future \nresearch on the personalization of prophylactic \naspirin dose according to patient-specific factors (eg, weight),\nS4.6-22 though we note that, regarding \nweight specifically, there was no evidence low-\ndose aspirin was any more effective in low-weight \nindividuals than in high-weight individuals in the more recently published ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events iN Diabetes) trial,\nS4.6-16 trial. \nMost importantly, recent clinical trials also teach \nus that low-dose prophylactic aspirin may be best \njustified among persons at high ASCVD risk who cannot achieve optimal control of other ASCVD risk factors.\nS4.6-23\n2. Prophylactic aspirin in primary-prevention adults >70 years of age is potentially harmful and, given the higher risk of bleeding in this age group, dif-\nficult to justify for routine use.\nS4.6-9 In addition, \nfor adults <40 years of age, there is insufficient \nevidence to judge the risk–benefit ratio of rou-\ntine aspirin for the primary prevention of ASCVD. \nHowever, one caveat is that, although routine use is not recommended in these settings, there is \nalso insufficient evidence to comment on whether there may be select circumstances in which physi-\ncians might discuss prophylactic aspirin with adults \n<40 years of age or >70 years of age in the con-text of other known ASCVD risk factors (eg, strong family history of premature MI, inability to achieve \nlipid or BP or glucose targets, or significant eleva-\ntion in coronary artery calcium score). As inferred from the first recommendation, there is also no justification for the routine administration of low-\ndose aspirin for the primary prevention of ASCVD among adults at low estimated ASCVD risk. For \nexample, in the recent ARRIVE (A Randomized Trial of Induction Versus Expectant Management) trial, observed average 10-year ASCVD risk was <10%, \nand the overall benefits of prophylactic aspirin by \nintention-to-treat were negligible.\nS4.6-17\n3. The accumulated trial and observational data to date support avoiding prophylactic aspirin in the \nsetting of known risk factors for increased bleeding \noutcomes.\nS4.6-10 A nonexhaustive list of conditions \nassociated with increased bleeding risk includes: \na history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or \npeptic ulcer disease or bleeding at other sites, age >70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, CKD, and concurrent use of other medications \nthat increase bleeding risk, such as nonsteroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, direct oral anti-\ncoagulants, and warfarin.\nS4.6-10\n5. COST AND VALUE CONSIDERATIONS\nThe growing need to consider value stems directly \nfrom the goal of achieving the best possible health \noutcomes with finite healthcare resources in the pri-\nmary prevention of CVD.S5-1 Value in health care can \nbe defined as the incremental health benefits of a \ntherapy or procedure relative to its incremental net \nlong-term costs. The consideration of cost and value \nin the guideline development process supports key \ngoals, including: 1) enhancing overall value in the de-livery of cardiovascular care and 2) involving health-care professionals in the challenging care decisions \nthat must be made to increase value in the US health-\ncare system.\nS5-2\nThe integration of value assessments into our na-\ntional guidelines involves inherent methodological chal-\nlenges, including: 1) variability in costs across different \nhealthcare settings; 2) variability in costs and benefits across different patient subgroups; 3) variability over \ntime; 4) variability in who bears the burden of the \nhealth outcome (ie, typically the individual patient) ver -\nsus who bears the burden of the healthcare cost (eg, often spread beyond the individual to third-party pay-\ners, taxpayers); and 5) an inadequate literature base on \nwhich to render a sound, evidence-based assessment of \ncertain specific therapies.\nS5-1,S5-2\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nArnett et al 2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease\nCirculation. 2019;140:e596–e646. DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000678 September 10, 2019\n e623\nCLINICAL STATEMENTS  \nAND GUIDELINESThere are additional challenges specific to the pre-\nvention realm. As described in the 2011 AHA policy \nstatement, “Value of Primordial and Primary Prevention in CVD”:\nS5-1\n“Assessing the value of prevention in appar -\nently healthy patients is generally more dif-ficult than evaluating therapy for established disease because the time horizon to the clinical manifestation of disease is generally \nlong—many decades in the young. Thus, it is \ndifficult, perhaps impossible, to assess long-term effectiveness in terms of survival or qual-\nity-adjusted life-years (QALYs) or associated \ncosts because of increasing uncertainty about \noutcome the further one tries to look into the \nfuture.”Furthermore, the principle of discounting, which \nplaces relative emphasis on current costs and benefits while deemphasizing downstream costs and benefits, creates disadvantages for prevention because costs of-ten accrue in the present while the benefit may only be \nfully realized long into the future. These methodologi-\ncal challenges notwithstanding, prior AHA statements \nhave highlighted the public policies, community ef-\nforts, and pharmacological interventions that are likely to be cost-effective and, at times, cost-saving preven-\ntion tactics compared with common benchmarks. For \nexample, robust evidence suggests that both antihy-pertensive therapy\nS5-3–S5-6 and statin therapy,S5-7–S5-9 par-\nticularly with low-cost generic drug formulations, are \nhigh-value interventions across a wide spectrum of risk \nand age strata.\nThe incorporation of the value category into clini-\ncal practice guidelines is one of several considerations \nin medical decision-making and resource allocation. \nClinicians, researchers, and policymakers must con-\ntinue to place cost-effective analyses in the proper \ncontext, extracting key value determinations while acknowledging the challenges in fully characterizing \nand incorporating the downstream benefits of a given \ntherapeutic prevention tactic. Further research and methodological advances are needed to comprehen-\nsively characterize the full spectrum of benefits pro-\nduced by the prevention approach, thereby rendering cost-effectiveness assessments more consequential to clinical practice.\n6. CONCLUSION\nMost ASCVD events are avoidable through primordial prevention (ie, the prevention of risk factor develop-\nment) and control of traditional cardiovascular risk fac-\ntors. Tobacco avoidance is critically important for AS-CVD prevention, and all adults should strive to engage in regular brisk physical activity most days of the week \nand adhere to a healthy dietary pattern to help lower future ASCVD risk. A diet high in fruits, vegetables, \nand whole grains is best. Fish, legumes, and poultry \nare the preferred sources of protein. Minimizing the \nconsumption of trans fats, added sugars (including \nsugar-sweetened beverages), red meats, sodium, and \nsaturated fats is also important. Clinicians should work \nin partnership with patients to assess their readiness \nfor sustained lifestyle improvements, identify poten-\ntial barriers to change, and encourage them to try to achieve measurable goals and continue to monitor their progress.\nS6-1 Finally, social determinants of ASCVD \nrisk—and their impact on the patient’s ability to pre-vent or treat risk factors—must be taken into account. \nClinicians need to consider patients’ health literacy and \neducation levels and assess patients’ motivation to im-\nprove their lifestyle habits.\nThe goal of the clinician is to match the intensity of \npreventive efforts with an individual’s absolute risk of a future ASCVD event and with the individual’s willing-\nness and capacity to implement preventive strategies. \nRisk estimation is imperfect and based on group aver -\nages that are then applied to individual patients. The clinician must balance an understanding of a patient’s estimated ASCVD risk with potential benefits and ad-verse risk from pharmacological therapy in the context \nof a risk discussion. To determine the appropriateness \nof pharmacological therapy after quantitative risk esti-mation in cases that are unclear, risk-enhancing factors or selective use of a coronary artery calcium measure-ment can inform decision-making for cholesterol-low-\nering or antihypertensive medication use in intermedi-\nate-risk individuals.\nThis primary-prevention guideline strives to pro-\nvide clinicians with the information they need to help their patients reduce their risk of ASCVD and encour -\nage them to make healthier lifestyle changes when \nneeded.\nACC/AHA TASK FORCE MEMBERS\nPatrick T.

More information on statin \ndrug–drug interactions can be obtained from the ACC \nLDL-C Manager.S3.2.1-20\n3.2.2. Nonstatin Therapies\nEzetimibe is the most commonly used nonstatin agent. \nIt lowers LDL-C levels by 13% to 20% and has a low in-\ncidence of side effects.S3.2.2-1,S3.2.2-2 Bile acid sequestrants \nreduce LDL-C levels by 15% to 30% depending on the \ndose. Bile acid sequestrants are not absorbed and do \nnot cause systemic side effects, but they are associated \nwith gastrointestinal complaints (eg, constipation) and \ncan cause severe hypertriglyceridemia when fasting tri-\nglycerides are ≥300 mg/dL (≥3.4 mmol/L). PCSK9 inhibi-\ntors are powerful LDL-lowering drugs. They generally \nare well tolerated, but long-term safety remains to be proven.S3.2.2-4–S3.2.2-6 Two categories of triglyceride-lower -\ning drugs, niacin and fibrates, may also mildly lower \nLDL-C levels in patients with normal triglycerides. They \nmay be useful in some patients with severe hypertri-\nglyceridemia, but in the present document they are not \nlisted as LDL-lowering drugs. See Table S4 in the Web \nSupplement.\n3.2.3. Nonstatin Add-on Drugs to Statin Therapy\nUnder certain circumstances, nonstatin medications \n(ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and PCSK9 inhibi-\ntors) may be useful in combination with statin therapy. \nThe addition of a bile acid sequestrant or ezetimibe to a \nstatin regimen increases the magnitude of LDL-C lower -\ning by approximately 15% to 30% and 13% to 20%, \nrespectively.S3.2.3-1,S3.2.3-2 The addition of a PCSK9 inhibi-\ntor to a statin regimen has been shown to further re-\nduce LDL-C levels by 43% to 64%.S3.2.3-3,S3.2.3-4 See Table \nS5 in the Web Supplement.\n4.

In patients who are 75 years of age or \nyounger with clinical ASCVD,* high-\nintensity statin therapy should be initiated or \ncontinued with the aim of achieving a 50% \nor greater reduction in LDL-C levels.S4.1-1–S4.1-5\nI A2.  In patients with clinical ASCVD in \nwhom high-intensity statin therapy is \ncontraindicated or who experience  \nstatin-associated side effects, moderate-\nintensity statin therapy should be initiated  \nor continued with the aim of achieving  \na 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C  \nlevels.S4.1-3,S4.1-6–S4.1-13\nI B-NR3.  In patients with clinical ASCVD who are \njudged to be very high risk and considered \nfor PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally \ntolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should \ninclude maximally tolerated statin therapy \nand ezetimibe.S4.1-14,S4.1-15\nIIa ASR4.  In patients with clinical ASCVD who are \njudged to be very high risk and who are on \nmaximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy \nwith LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥1.8 \nmmol/L) or a non–HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL \nor higher (≥2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to \nadd a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician–\npatient discussion about the net benefit, \nsafety, and cost.S4.1-15–S4.1-19\nIIa B-R5.  In patients with clinical ASCVD who are on \nmaximally tolerated statin therapy and are \njudged to be at very high risk and have an \nLDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥1.8 \nmmol/L), it is reasonable to add ezetimibe \ntherapy.S4.1-14,S4.1-15Table 3.

The writ-\ning group used primarily the Cholesterol Treatment Tri-\nalists’ (CTT) meta-analysisS4.1-3,S4.1-4 of statin RCTs plus \n4 other RCTs.S4.1-1,S4.1-2,S4.1-38,S4.1-45 Additional RCTs have \nused nonstatin drugs as add-ons to statin therapy and \nare included here. As a primary recommendation, high-\nintensity statin therapy is indicated for clinical ASCVD, \nbut if this cannot be used, moderate-intensity statin \ntherapy can be initiated (Figure 1). The first goal is to \nachieve a ≥50% reduction in LDL-C levels, but if LDL-C \nlevels remains ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L) on maximally \ntolerated statin therapy, adding ezetimibe may be rea-\nsonable. In patients >75 years of age with ASCVD, po-\ntential benefits versus adverse effects of statin therapy \nshould be considered before initiation of statin therapy. Finally, in very high-risk patients with multiple high-risk \nclinical factors, ezetimibe can be added to maximally \ntolerated statin therapy. Furthermore, if LDL-C levels \nremain ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L), adding a PCSK9 in-\nhibitor is reasonable if the cost/benefit ratio is favor -\nable. In patients with HF due to ischemic heart disease, \nmoderate-intensity statins may be considered.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. CTT meta-analysisS4.1-3,S4.1-4 showed that LDL-C \nlowering with statins reduces major ASCVD \nevents. Patients with strokeS4.1-1 or peripheral \nartery diseaseS4.1-5 also derive these benefits. In \na meta-analysis of 5 RCTs,S4.1-3 high-intensity \nstatins compared with moderate-intensity statin \ntherapy, significantly reduced major vascular \nevents by 15% with no significant reduction in \ncoronary deaths. Large absolute LDL-C reduction \nwas associated with a larger proportional reduc-\ntion in major vascular events.S4.1-4 High-intensity \nstatin therapy generally reduces LDL-C levels by \n≥50%. This percentage can be used to judge \nclinical efficacy. Absolute benefit from statin ther -\napy depends on baseline LDL-C levels; the great-\nest absolute benefit accrues to patients with the \nhighest baseline LDL-C levels. Percentage reduc-\ntion of LDL-C levels is the most efficient means \nto estimate expected efficacy. An alternative to \nevaluating adequacy of therapy is to examine \nLDL-C on maximum-intensity statins. In a patient \nwith ASCVD, if LDL-C level is ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 \nmmol/L), adding ezetimibe may be reasonable \n(see",

Even \nso, only very small numbers (3% and 5% respec-\ntively) were on ezetimibe during these trials. The \nstrategy of ezetimibe before PCSK9 inhibitor is \nrecommended because ezetimibe is widely avail-\nable as a generic drug and has proven safety and \ntolerability.S4.1-15 This approach is supported by 2 \nsimulation studies from large populations of very \nhigh-risk patients; these reports showed that \naddition of ezetimibe to statin therapy will lower \nLDL-C to <70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) in the major -\nity of patients, leaving a minority eligible for a \nPCSK9 inhibitor.S4.1-42,S4.1-43 These 2 well-designed \nsimulation studies favor the strategy of addition of ezetimibe before PCSK9 inhibitor and warrants \nan LOE of B-NR.\n4.

Nevertheless, the decision to ini-\ntiate moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy \nin patients >75 years of age with ASCVD should \nbe based on expected benefit versus competing \ncomorbidities.S4.1-23–S4.1-31\n8. This recommendation is based on the observa-\ntion that the age reported in clinical trials of statin \ntherapy in patients with ASCVD represents the \npatient’s age at study entry. Therefore, it is rea-\nsonable to consider continuation of high-intensity \ntherapy in patients >75 years of age with ASCVD \nif they are tolerating the statin and have a low \nrisk of competing morbidities.S4.1-23,S4.1-26,S4.1-31  \nRCTsS4.1-32,S4.1-33,S4.1-35,S4.1-36 have not shown an \nadverse effect of statin therapy on cognition.\n9. Although moderate-intensity statin therapy \nreduces ASCVD events, it is less effective than \nhigh-intensity therapy.S4.1-3 This difference pre-\nsumably is due to differences in LDL-C–lowering \npotency. Hence, if ezetimibe were to be added to \na moderate-intensity therapy to compensate for \nthe difference in LDL-C–lowering ability between \nmoderate- and high-intensity statins, the combi-\nnation of moderate-intensity statin and ezetimibe \ncould potentially produce a level of ASCVD risk \nreduction similar to that produced by high-inten-\nsity therapy alone. This hypothesis is supported by \nthe finding that ezetimibe enhanced risk reduc-\ntion when combined with moderate-intensity \ntherapy in patients after ACS.S4.1-15 Thus, it may be \nreasonable to add ezetimibe to moderate-inten-\nsity therapy in patients with ASCVD for whom \nhigh-intensity therapy is indicated but cannot be \nused, provided their LDL-C level remains ≥70 mg/\ndL (≥1.8 mmol/L) on moderate-intensity therapy. \nThe same reasoning holds for any patient whose \nLDL-C level remains ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L) on \nmaximally tolerated statin therapy\n10.

Neither trial \nmet its primary outcome. Rosuvastatin reduced \nthe risk of total hospitalizations, hospitalizations \nfor a cardiovascular cause, and hospitalizations for \nworsening HF in CORONA. A subsequent analysis \naccounting for repeat HF hospitalizations showed \nsignificant reduction in HF hospitalizations.S4.1-46 Post hoc analyses from CORONA showed that \npatients randomized to rosuvastatin with less \nadvanced HF with reduced ejection fraction (low-\nest tertile of NT-proBNP) had a significant reduction \nin the primary outcome, but no benefit was seen \namong patients with more advanced HF.S4.1-47 The \nCORONA and GISSI studies were notable for high \noverall and cardiovascular mortality rates, with \nMI occurring in a small minority.

These pa-\ntients derive net ASCVD risk reduction benefit from \ninterventions that increase expression of LDL receptors. \nThe strongest data have been derived from statin RCTs, \nwhich have demonstrated greater risk reduction with \nstatins than with placebo and greater reduction from \nhigher-intensity statin therapy than with moderate-\nintensity statin therapy. Ezetimibe plus a moderate-in-\ntensity statin is associated with greater LDL-C reduction \nthan is statin monotherapy in patients with hetero-\nzygous FH, and the combination reduces ASCVD risk \nmore than moderate-intensity statin monotherapy in \npatients who have had a recent ACS. In selected pa-\ntients with severe hypercholesterolemia whose LDL-C is \ninadequately controlled with drug therapy, LDL apher -\nesis is an option. Referral to a lipid specialist may be \nindicated.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. Patients with primary severe hypercholesterolemia \n(LDL-C levels ≥190 mg/dL [≥4.9 mmol/L]) have a \nhigh-risk of ASCVDS4.2-2,S4.2-4,S4.2-18 and premature \nand recurrent coronary events.S4.2-3 Although there \nhave been no randomized, placebo-controlled tri-\nals of statin therapy done exclusively in subjects \nwith LDL-C levels ≥190 mg/dL (≥4.9 mmol/L), \na placebo-controlled primary prevention study \nperformed in men with a mean baseline LDL-C \nlevel of 192±17 mg/dL (4.9±0.4 mmol/L) demon-\nstrated a reduced incidence of MI and cardiovas-\ncular death in those receiving pravastatin 40 mg \ndaily.S4.2-5 These findings were extended in a post \nhoc analysis of 2 560 exclusively primary-preven-\ntion subjects in that RCT and in a 20-year observa-\ntional post-trial long-term follow-up study.S4.2-19 In \naddition, retrospective cohort studies have dem-\nonstrated that statin therapy reduces risk of inci-\ndent MIS4.2-6 and of CHD and all-cause deathS4.2-1 \nin patients with phenotypic or genetically con-\nfirmed FH. Because moderate- or high-intensity \nstatins have been shown to reduce ASCVD risk \nin both primary- and secondary-prevention trials \nand because high-intensity statins provide greater \nASCVD risk reduction than moderate-intensity \nstatins or placebo,S4.2-7 maximally tolerated statin \ntherapy should be administered to patients with \nprimary severe hypercholesterolemia.\n2. A large placebo-controlled RCT examined the \neffect of simvastatin 80 mg daily, with or without \nezetimibe 10 mg daily, on carotid intima-media thickness and plasma lipoproteins over 2 years. \nMean LDL-C reduction was greater in the com-\nbined-therapy group, but there was no difference \nin carotid intima-media thickness between the 2 \ngroups. The study was not powered to examine \nthe risk of ASCVD events.S4.2-10 However, a very \nlarge placebo-controlled RCT examining ASCVD \noutcomes in post-ACS patients, performed over \na period of 7 years, showed that the addition \nof ezetimibe 10 mg to simvastatin 40 mg daily \nresulted in greater ASCVD risk reduction than that \nproduced by statin monotherapy.S4.2-8 Secondary-\nprevention patients with certain ASCVD risk indi-\ncators exhibit greater ASCVD risk reduction from \nezetimibe therapy than do patients without these \ncharacteristics.S4.2-20 Patients with severe hyper -\ncholesterolemia who are adherent to statins, \nachieve <50% reduction in LDL-C levels with \nmaximally tolerated statin therapy, and have an \nLDL-C level ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.6 mmol/L) are likely \nto derive additional ASCVD risk reduction from \nezetimibe add-on therapy through additional \nLDL-C lowering.S4.2-9\n3. When administered to patients with severe hyper -\ncholesterolemia who are taking maximally toler -\nated statins with or without ezetimibe, bile acid \nsequestrants have demonstrated LDL-C-lowering \nefficacy.S4.2-11,S4.2-12 However, the clinical utility of \nbile acid sequestrants is limited by the absence \nof ASCVD outcomes data when used in combi-\nnation with statins, as well as by the issues of \ntwice-daily dosing, high pill burden, the absence \nof well-tolerated generic formulations, drug inter -\nactions, and the potential for triglyceride eleva-\ntion.

In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes \nmellitus and an LDL-C level of 70 to 189 \nmg/dL (1.7 to 4.8 mmol/L), it is reasonable \nto assess the 10-year risk of a first ASCVD \nevent by using the race and sex-specific PCE \nto help stratify ASCVD risk.S4.3-10,S4.3-11\nIIa B-R3.

In adults with diabetes mellitus and 10-year \nASCVD risk of 20% or higher, it may be \nreasonable to add ezetimibe to maximally \ntolerated statin therapy to reduce LDL-C \nlevels by 50% or more.S4.3-14,S4.3-15\nIIb C-LD6.  In adults older than 75 years with diabetes \nmellitus, it may be reasonable to initiate \nstatin therapy after a clinician–patient \ndiscussion of potential benefits and  \nrisks.S4.3-5,S4.3-8,S4.3-13\nIIb C-LD7.  In adults 20 to 39 years of age with diabetes \nmellitus that is either of long duration (≥10 \nyears of type 2 diabetes mellitus, ≥20 years \nof type 1 diabetes mellitus), albuminuria \n(≥30 mcg of albumin/mg creatinine), \nestimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \nless than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, retinopathy, \nneuropathy, or ankle-brachial index (ABI; \n<0.9), it may be reasonable to initiate statin \ntherapy.S4.3-5,S4.3-6,S4.3-8,S4.3-16–S4.3-25\nSynopsis\nAlthough most adults 40 to 75 years of age with dia-\nbetes mellitus are at intermediate or high-risk of their \nfirst ASCVD event,S4.3-5,S4.3-6,S4.3-8,S4.3-9 evaluation of AS-\nCVD risk will help refine risk estimates and therapeu-\ntic decision-making. Because primary-prevention trials \ndemonstrate that moderate-intensity statin therapy in \nlarge cohorts with diabetes mellitus provides significant \nbenefit,S4.3-1–S4.3-4,S4.3-7 this treatment is indicated in such \nindividuals. However, given the increased morbidity \nand mortality associated with a first event in diabetes \nmellitus and the residual risk among the statin-treated \ngroups in these trials, together with the evidence of \nbenefit from high-intensity statin treatment in primary \nprevention among men >50 years of age and women \n>60 years of age,S4.3-13 high-intensity statin therapy to \nmaximize risk reduction is preferred for patients with \ndiabetes mellitus as they age or if they have risk modi-\nfiers. Adults 20 to 39 years of age are mostly at low \n10-year risk, although moderate-intensity statin thera-\npy in those with long-standing diabetes mellitus or a \nconcomitant higher-risk condition may be reasonable \n(Table 5).S4.3-17,S4.3-20,S4.3-21 Adults >75 years of age with Recommendations for Patients With Diabetes Mellitus (Continued)\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nGrundy et al 2018 Cholesterol Clinical Practice Guidelines\nJune 18/25, 2019 Circulation. 2019;139:e1082–e1143. DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000625\n e1098\nCLINICAL STATEMENTS  \nAND GUIDELINESdiabetes mellitus are at high-riskS4.3-5,S4.3-8 and clinical \ntrial evidenceS4.3-26 suggests they are likely to benefit \nfrom continuing or initiating statin therapy, although \nthis may be compromised by reduced longevity and in-\ncreased adverse events.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. Most adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes  \nmellitus are at intermediate or high-risk (PCE ≥7.5% \n10-year risk) of ASCVD events.S4.3-5,S4.3-6,S4.3-8,S4.3-9  \nThree of 4 double-blinded primary-preven-\ntion RCTs of moderate statin therapy in large \ncohorts with diabetes mellitus in this age \nrange showed significant reductions in ASCVD  \nevents.S4.3-1,S4.3-2,S4.3-4,S4.3-7 A meta-analysis of these \ntrials found that moderate-intensity statin therapy \nis associated with a risk reduction of 25%,S4.3-3 \nresulting in a risk level similar to that of people \nwithout diabetes mellitus and with no apparent \ndifference in benefit between type 1 and type \n2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, on the basis of a \nhigh level of evidence, moderate-intensity statin \ntherapy is indicated in patients 40 to 75 years of \nage with diabetes mellitus for primary prevention.\n2. Although it is well recognized that the frequency \nof a first ASCVD event in adults with diabetes \nmellitus is significantly increased compared with \nthose without diabetes mellitus, there is a wide \nspectrum of risk among individuals with diabe-\ntes mellitusS4.3-5,S4.3-6,S4.3-8,S4.3-9 that varies with age, \nduration of diabetes mellitus, and the presence \nof traditional risk factors and risk modifiers com-\nmon to the general population, as well as those \nspecific to the population with diabetes mellitus \n(Table 5). Because the decision to upgrade statin \ntreatment from moderate to high intensity is \ninfluenced by the level of ASCVD risk, the PCE \nrisk estimator in adults 40 to 75 years of age with \ndiabetes mellitus has utility in refining treatment \ndecisions in these patients.S4.3-10,S4.3-11 The ASCVD risk score, however, does not determine whether \nstatin intensity should be increased. Rather, it \nbegins an evaluation that includes clinician judg-\nment of the individual’s global risk, the potential \nfor benefit from a high-intensity statin versus the \npotential for adverse effects or drug-drug interac-\ntions and evaluation should also include patient \npreferences and values.\n3. The occurrence of a first ASCVD event in patients \n40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus is \nassociated with increased morbidity and mortality \ncompared with those without diabetes mellitus, \nwhich places a particularly high premium on pri-\nmary prevention in those with diabetes mellitus in \nthat age range. Although trials using moderate-\nintensity statin therapy demonstrate significant \nbenefit in such individuals, the residual risk in the \nstatin treatment groups in these trials remained \nhigh (eg, 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in \n3.8 years).S4.3-3 Strong general evidence indicates \nthat the benefit from statin therapy is related to \nboth global risk and intensity of treatment,S4.3-12 \nand no RCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have \nbeen carried out in cohorts of patients exclusively \nwith diabetes mellitus. On the basis of these con-\nsiderations and the fact that patients with diabe-\ntes mellitus have a higher trajectory of lifetime risk \nthan do those without diabetes mellitus, high-\nintensity statin therapy is preferred in patients \nwith diabetes mellitus as they age or develop risk \nmodifiers (Table 5).\n4. ASCVD risk increases incrementally with age in \ndiabetes mellitus.S4.3-5,S4.3-6,S4.3-8 In one long-term \ncohort study of type 2 diabetes mellitus with-\nout ASCVD, incident rates of MI averaged 25.6 \nper 1000 person-yearsS4.3-5 in those >75 years of \nage, while another in a type 1 diabetes mellitus \ncohort found the 10-year fatal CVD risk in those \n>75 years of age was 70% in men and 40% in \nwomen.S4.3-8 Although no controlled statin tri-\nals in people >75 years of age are available, a \nmeta-analysis of the JUPITER (Justification for \nthe Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention \nTrial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) and HOPE-3 (Heart \nOutcomes Prevention Evaluation) trials dem-\nonstrated similar benefits in ASCVD reduc-\ntion among those >70 of age versus <70 years \nof age.S4.3-26 Although that study included few \npatients with diabetes mellitus, it does support \nthe continuation of moderate- or high-intensity \nstatin therapy for primary prevention in those >75 \nyears of age with diabetes mellitus, who comprise \n21% of the population in this age category. The \nclinician should note that the benefit may be off-\nset by limited life span or increased susceptibility \nto adverse events in patients in this age group.Table 5. Diabetes-Specific Risk Enhancers That Are Independent of \nOther Risk Factors in Diabetes Mellitus\nRisk Enhancers\n    Long duration (≥10 years for type 2 diabetes mellitusS4.3-20 or ≥20 years \nfor type 1 diabetes mellitusS4.3-6\n    Albuminuria ≥30 mcg of albumin/mg creatinineS4.3-25\n    eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2S4.3-25\n    RetinopathyS4.3-19\n    NeuropathyS4.3-16\n    ABI <0.9S4.3-22,S4.3-24\nABI indicates ankle-brachial index; and eGFR, estimated glomerular \nfiltration rate.\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nGrundy et al 2018 Cholesterol Clinical Practice Guidelines\nCirculation. 2019;139:e1082–e1143. DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000625 June 18/25, 2019\n e1099\nCLINICAL STATEMENTS  \nAND GUIDELINES5. According to a CTT analysis,S4.3-12 the higher \nthe 10-year ASCVD risk, the greater is the ben-\nefit from increased LDL-C reduction. This is \nsupported by the meta-analyses comparing high-\nintensity versus -low-intensity statin therapyS4.3-12 \nand those comparing the benefit of statins and \nnonstatin therapeutic agents (ie, ezetimibe, bile \nsequestrants, PCSK9 antagonists) that upregu-\nlate LDL receptors.S4.3-27 Therefore, a risk discus-\nsion may be held on the benefits of achieving \n≥50% LDL-C lowering in adults with diabetes \nmellitus who have ≥20% ASCVD risk. Addition \nof ezetimibe 10 mg/d to moderate-intensity statin \ntherapy can achieve the same percent LDL-C low-\nering as that achieved with high-intensity statin \ntherapy.S4.3-14 In this RCT, 27% of patients had \ndiabetes mellitus.S4.3-28 Thus, ezetimibe added to \na moderate-intensity statin can be considered if a \nhigh-intensity statin cannot be tolerated or does \nnot lower LDL-C, as expected, by ≥50%.\n6. Although the risk of ASCVD is high in adults >75 \nyears of age with diabetes mellitusS4.3-5,S4.3-6,S4.3-8 \nwho are not receiving statin therapy, particularly \nthose with additional risk factors or risk modifi-\ners, the benefit of initiating statin therapy in these \nindividuals may be limited by their reduced life \nspan or increased susceptibility to adverse effects \nof treatment. Among this group will also be indi-\nviduals with recent or newly diagnosed diabetes \nmellitus for whom the impact of diabetes mellitus \non ASCVD risk is not well known. It may there-\nfore be reasonable to have a clinician–patient dis-\ncussion in which the potential benefits and risks \nof initiating statin therapy in this age group are \nreviewed.\n7. There is limited information on ASCVD rates \namong individuals 20 to 39 years of age with \ndiabetes mellitus and no information on whether \nstatin therapy is beneficial in these individuals. \nAvailable evidence indicates that although rates \nof ASCVD are low in those <30 years of age, \nthey increase with timeS4.3-6,S4.3-17,S4.3-20,S4.3-23 and \nmay reach intermediate-risk levels by 30 to 39 \nyears of age, especially in individuals with long-\nstanding type 2 diabetes mellitus,S4.3-17 who may \nhave more advanced subclinical coronary athero-\nsclerosis than do nondiabetic subjects,S4.3-21 and in \nthose with type 1 diabetes mellitus of >20 years’ \nduration.S4.3-23 ASCVD rates will also be influ-\nenced by hypertension and diabetic microvascu-\nlar complications that may be prevalent in these \nage groups.S4.3-18,S4.3-23 Thus, it may be reasonable \nto have a discussion about initiating moderate-\nintensity statin therapy with patients who have \nhad type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 10 years \nor type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least 20 years and with patients with 1 or more major CVD \nrisk factors or complications, such as diabetic \nretinopathy,S4.3-19 neuropathy,S4.3-16 nephropathy \n(eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria ≥30 \nmcg albumin/mg creatinine),S4.3-25 or an ABI of \n<0.9S4.3-22,S4.3-24 (Table 5).\n4.4. Primary Prevention\nPrimary prevention of ASCVD over the life span requires \nattention to prevention or management of ASCVD risk \nfactors beginning early in life (Figure 2). One major AS-\nCVD risk factor is elevated serum cholesterol, usually \nidentified clinically as measured LDL-C. Screening can \nbe performed with fasting or nonfasting measurement \nof lipids. In children, adolescents (10 to 19 years of age), \nand young adults (20 to 39 years of age), priority should \nbe given to estimation of lifetime risk and promotion of \nlifestyle risk reduction. Drug therapy is needed only in se-\nlected patients with moderately high LDL-C levels (≥160 \nmg/dL [≥4.1 mmol/L]) or patients with very high LDL-C \nlevels (190 mg/dL [4.9 mmol/L]). Three major higher-risk \ncategories are patients with severe hypercholesterol-\nemia (LDL-C levels ≥190 mg/dL [≥4.9 mmol/L]), adults \nwith diabetes mellitus, and adults 40 to 75 years of age. \nPatients with severe hypercholesterolemia and adults 40 \nto 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus are candidates \nfor immediate statin therapy without further risk assess-\nment. Adults with diabetes mellitus should start with a \nmoderate-intensity statin, and as they accrue multiple \nrisk factors, a high-intensity statin may be indicated. In \nother adults 40 to 75 years of age, 10-year ASCVD risk \nshould guide therapeutic considerations. The higher the \nestimated ASCVD risk, the more likely the patient is to \nbenefit from evidence-based statin treatment. The risk \ndiscussion should also consider several “risk enhancers” \nthat can be used to favor initiation or intensification of \nstatin therapy. When risk is uncertain or if statin ther -\napy is problematic, it can be helpful to measure CAC \nto refine risk assessment. A CAC score predicts ASCVD \nevents in a graded fashion and is independent of other \nrisk factors, such as age, sex, and ethnicity.S4.4-1 A CAC \nscore equal to zero is useful for reclassifying patients to \na lower-risk group, often allowing statin therapy to be \nwithheld or postponed unless higher risk conditions are \npresent. For patients >75 years of age, RCT evidence \nfor statin therapy is not strong, so clinical assessment of \nrisk status in a clinician–patient risk discussion is need-\ned for deciding whether to continue or initiate statin \ntreatment.S4.4-2–S4.4-21\n4.4.1.

Risk-Enhancing Factors\nModerate intensity generic statins allow for efficacious \nand cost-effective primary prevention in patients with a \n10-year risk of ASCVD ≥7.5%.S4.4.1.3-1 Since 2013 ACC/\nAHA guidelines,S4.4.1.3-2 the HOPE-3 RCTS4.4.1.3-3 provided \nadditional support for this finding. The pooled cohort \nequation (PCE) is the single most robust tool for esti-\nmating 10-year risk in US adults 40 to 75 years of age. \nIts strength can be explained by inclusion of major, in-\ndependent risk factors. One limitation on the PCE when \napplied to individuals is that age counts as a risk factor \nand dominates risk scoring with advancing age. Age is \na powerful population risk factor but does not neces-\nsarily reflect individual risk. Another factor influencing \nrisk are baseline characteristics of populations (baseline \nrisk). These characteristics include both genetic and ac-\nquired risk factors other than established major risk fac-\ntors. Variation in baseline risk accounts for difference in \nrisk in different ethnic groups. Absolute risk predictions \ndepend on the baseline risk of a population (eg, the US \npopulation). These considerations in patients at inter -\nmediate risk leave room in the clinician-patient risk dis-\ncussion to withhold or delay initiation of statin therapy, \ndepending on age, pattern of risk factors, and patient \npreferences and values.\nIn sum, the PCE is a powerful tool to predict \npopulation risk, but it has limitations when applied \nto individuals. One purpose of the clinician patient \nrisk discussion is to individualize risk status based on PCE as well as other factors that may inform risk \nprediction. Among these other factors are the risk-\nenhancing factors discussed in this guideline. These \nrisk-enhancing factors are listed in Table 6, and evi-\ndence base and strength of association with ASCVD \nare shown in Table S6. In the general population, \nthey may or may not predict risk independently of \nPCE. But in the clinician–patient risk discussion they \ncan be useful for identifying specific factors that in-\nfluence risk. Their presence helps to confirm a higher \nrisk state and thereby supports a decision to initi-\nate or intensify statin therapy. They are useful for \nclarifying which atherogenic factors are present in a \nparticular patient. And in some patients, certain risk-\nenhancing factors carry greater lifetime risk than de-\nnoted by 10-year risk prediction in the PCE. Finally, \nseveral risk-enhancing factors may be specific targets \ntherapy beyond those of the PCE.\nA few comments may illustrate the potential use-\nfulness of risk-enhancing factors in the patient discus-\nsion.

The presence of family history of ASCVD, pre-\nmature menopause, and patients of South Asian race \nappear to convey a higher baseline risk and are stron-\nger candidates for statin therapy. Conditions associated \nwith systemic inflammation (chronic inflammatory dis-\norders, metabolic syndrome, chronic renal disease, and \nelevated hsCRP) appear to predispose to atherothrom-\nbotic events, which reasonably justifies statin therapy in \nintermediate-risk patients.\n4.4.1.4. Coronary Artery Calcium\nSubstantial advances in estimation of risk with CAC \nscoring have been made in the past 5 years. One pur -\npose of CAC scoring is to reclassify risk identification \nof patients who will potentially benefit from statin \ntherapy. This is especially useful when the clinician \nand patient are uncertain whether to start a statin. \nIndeed, the most important recent observation has been \nthe finding that a CAC score of zero indicates a low \nASCVD risk for the subsequent 10 years.S4.4.1.4-1–S4.4.1.4-8  \nThus, measurement of CAC potentially allows a cli-\nnician to withhold statin therapy in patients show-\ning zero CAC. There are exceptions. For example, \nCAC scores of zero in persistent cigarette smokers, \npatients with diabetes mellitus, those with a strong \nfamily history of ASCVD, and possibly chronic inflam-\nmatory conditions such as HIV, may still be associated \nwith substantial 10-year risk.S4.4.1.4-9–S4.4.1.4-12 Neverthe-\nless, a sizable portion of middle-aged and older pa-\ntients have zero CAC, which may allow withholding of \nstatin therapy in those intermediate risk patients who \nwould otherwise have a high enough risk according \nto the PCE to receive statin therapy (Figure 2). Most \npatients with CAC scores ≥100 Agatston units have \na 10-year risk of ASCVD ≥7.5%, a widely accepted \nthreshold for initiation of statin therapy.S4.4.1.4-13 With \nincreasing age, 10-year risk accompanying CAC scores \nof 1 to 99 rises, usually crossing the 7.5% threshold in \nlater middle age.S4.4.1.4-13 When the CAC score is zero, \nsome investigators favor remeasurement of CAC af-\nter 5 to 10 years.S4.4.1.4-14–S4.4.1.4-16 CAC measurement \nhas no utility in patients already treated with statins. \nStatins are associated with slower progression of over -\nall coronary atherosclerosis volume and reduction of \nhigh-risk plaque features, yet statins increase the CAC \nscore.S4.4.1.4-17 A prospective randomized study of CAC \nscoring showed improved risk factor modification \nwithout an increase in downstream medical testing or \ncost.S4.4.1.4-18 In MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Athero-\nsclerosis), CAC scanning delivered 0.74 to l.27 mSv \nof radiation, which is similar to the dose of a clinical \nmammogram.S4.4.1.4-19 CAC scans should be ordered by a clinician who is fully versed in the pros and cons of \ndiagnostic radiology.\n4.4.2.

For the primary prevention of clinical \nASCVD* in adults 40 to 75 years of age \nwithout diabetes mellitus and with an \nLDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.7 to 4.8 \nmmol/L), the 10-year ASCVD risk of a first \n“hard” ASCVD event (fatal and nonfatal MI \nor stroke) should be estimated by using the \nrace- and sex-specific PCE, and adults should \nbe categorized as being at low risk (<5%), \nborderline risk (5% to <7.5%), intermediate-\nrisk (≥7.5% to <20%), and high-risk \n(≥20%).S4.4.2-10,S4.4.2-11\nI B-NR4.

In patients at borderline risk, in risk \ndiscussion, the presence of risk-enhancing \nfactors may justify initiation of moderate-\nintensity statin therapy.S4.4.2-17,S4.4.2-24\n*Definition of clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndrome (ACS), \nthose with history of myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina or \ncoronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack \n(TIA), or peripheral artery disease (PAD) including aortic aneurysm, all of \natherosclerotic origin.\nSynopsis\nAdults 40 to 75 years of age in primary prevention can \nbe classified as borderline risk (10-year risk of ASCVD \n5% to <7.5%), intermediate-risk (7.5% to <20%), \nand high-risk (20%). For intermediate-risk patients, \nmoderate- to high-intensity statin therapy should be \nconsidered during risk discussion of treatment options. \nAdditional considerations favoring use of statins in in-\ntermediate-risk patients include other independent risk \nconditions and, in selected individuals, risk-enhancing \nfactors associated with greater ASCVD risk (Table 6). \nAlthough the variability of percent LDL-C lowering \nwith high-intensity statin use is wide, its efficacy is \nproportional to the magnitude of the LDL-C reduction \nobtained.S4.4.2-18 Systematic reviews indicate that those \nwith higher baseline ASCVD risk derive greater absolute \nbenefit from higher percent LDL-C reduction with evi-\ndence-based therapy.S4.4.2-1,S4.4.2-7 Accordingly, if a statin \nis given, LDL-C levels should be reduced by ≥30% and \noptimally by ≥50%. When there is uncertainty, consid-\neration of risk-enhancing factors including family his-\ntory of premature ASCVD and CAC score, categorical \nrisk factors, and selected biomarkers may inform the \ndecision. CAC scoring is especially useful in older adults \nto improve specificity.S4.4.2-15 A CAC score of zero revises \nASCVD risk downward and selects adults who show \nreduced benefit from starting a statin.S4.4.2-20\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. Prior guidelines recommended moderate- or high-\nintensity statins as first-line LDL-C–lowering ther -\napy in primary prevention of ASCVD after a risk \ndiscussion of treatment options. This was based \non 3 large-scale exclusively primary-prevention RCTs that demonstrated that moderate-intensity \nstatin therapyS4.4.2-5,S4.4.2-25 and high-intensity statin \ntherapyS4.4.2-6 were associated with ASCVD risk \nreduction that outweighed the observable risks. \nSince those ACC/AHA 2013 guidelines, a large-\nscale RCT in a racially/ethnically diverse population \nconfirmed statin benefit from a moderate-inten-\nsity dose of a statin as compared with placebo in \nintermediate-risk patients. That RCT enrolled men \n≥55 years of age and women ≥65 years of age \nwith at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor. In the \nplacebo group, the 10-year risk of “hard” ASCVD \nwas 8.7%, and the risk of the expanded ASCVD \nendpoint that included coronary revascularization \nwas 10%.S4.4.2-8 After 5.6 years, those assigned \nto rosuvastatin 10 mg/d demonstrated signifi-\ncant ARR in both co-primary endpoints with an \nacceptable safety record. By comparison, after a \nmedian follow-up of 1.9 years, those assigned a \nhigh-intensity dose of rosuvastatin in the JUPITER \nRCT achieved greater LDL-C-lowering and greater \nreductions in ASCVD outcomes. This corroborates \nmeta-analyses demonstrating increased net ben-\nefit of evidence-based LDL-C–lowering therapy \nin those at risk if greater reductions in LDL-C are \nattained.S4.4.2-1,S4.4.2-9\n2. If in the context of a risk discussion, maximal \nASCVD risk reduction is desired, it is reasonable \nto use a high-intensity statin to lower LDL-C by \n≥50%. This provides increased benefit, espe-\ncially when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥20%. JUPITER \nenrolled men ≥50 years of age and women 60 \nyears of age with high-sensitivity C-reactive \nprotein values 2.0 mg/L. Participants randomly \nassigned to 20 mg/d of rosuvastatin achieved \nmedian reductions in LDL-C of 50% and highly \nsignificant ASCVD risk reduction at 1.9 years.S4.4.2-6 \nThe trial was stopped prematurely because of \na highly significant reduction in cardiovascular \ndeath. However, wide individual variability in per -\ncent LDL-C reduction was noted. Importantly, the \nmagnitude of the percent LDL-C reduction deter -\nmined benefit.S4.4.2-18 The US Preventive Services \nTask Force systematic review of statin therapy \nin primary prevention showed a reduced risk of \nall-cause and cardiovascular death and ASCVD \nevents and noted greater absolute benefits in \nthose at greater baseline risk,S4.4.2-4 consistent \nwith other high-quality systematic reviews and \nmeta-analyses.S4.4.2-1,S4.4.2-7,S4.4.2-24 This underscores \nthe need for aggressive and safe risk reduction in \nthe highest-risk groups and the need for follow-\nup LDL-C testing to determine adherence and \nadequacy of effect of the prescribed statin.S4.4.2-26\n3.

Evidence shows that a CAC score of zero can \n“down-risk” individuals who otherwise would \nqualify for a statin on the basis of their ASCVD \n10-year risk. The ability to select those who would \nbenefit greatly from statin therapy, as shown by \nRCTs in primary-prevention populationsS4.4.2-6,S4.4.2-8 \nand yet to withhold statin therapy in those least \nlikely to benefit would improve specificity.S4.4.2-34 \nFor example, a CAC score of zero in an analysis \nof pooled US population-based studies accurately \ndiscriminated between lower and higher CHD risk \nin older adults.S4.4.2-19,S4.4.2-27 The BioImage Study \nin older adultsS4.4.2-15 and MESAS4.4.2-17 showed \nimproved detection of individuals not likely to benefit from statins when the CAC score was \nzero. Selected examples of candidates for CAC \nscoring who might benefit from knowing their \nCAC score is zero are listed in Table 8.

In adults at intermediate-risk (predicted 10-year \nrisk of 7.5% to <20%), substantial data indicate \nhow CAC measurement can be effective in mean-\ningfully reclassifying risk in a large proportion of \nindividuals.S4.4.2-15,S4.4.2-17,S4.4.2-36–S4.4.2-49 In such inter -\nmediate-risk adults, those with a CAC score ≥100 \nAgatston units or CAC ≥75th percentile appear \nto have ASCVD event rates suggesting that statin \ntherapy would be beneficial.S4.4.2-17,S4.4.2-23 Those \nwith a CAC of zero appear to have 10-year event \nrates in a lower range that suggests statin therapy \nmay be of limited value for these patients, with \nfew exceptions including patients with diabetes \nmellitus, persistent smoking, and family history or \npremature ASCVD. Cigarette smoking remains a \nstrong risk factor even in the presence of CAC \nscore of zero.S4.4.2-50,S4.4.2-51 In asymptomatic dia-\nbetes mellitus, a CAC score of zero is associated \nwith a favorable 5-year prognosis; but after 5 \nyears, the risk of mortality increases significantly \nfor diabetic individuals even in the presence of a \nbaseline CAC score of zero.S4.4.2-52 In patients with \na family history of ASCVD, CAC score of zero may \nimpart less short-term benefit from statin therapy, \nbut considering a high lifetime risk, long-term Table 8.

Therefore, \nfor patients with CAC scores of 1 to 99, it is \nreasonable to repeat the risk discussion. If these \npatients remain untreated, repeat CAC measure-\nment in 5 to 10 years may have some value in \nreassessing for CAC progression, but data are  \nlimited.S4.4.2-12,S4.4.2-13 A systematic review and \nmeta-analysis suggests that knowledge that \na patient’s CAC score is greater than zero is \nbeneficial.S4.4.2-38 Selected examples of candidates \nfor CAC scoring who might benefit from know-\ning that their CAC score is zero are listed in Table \n8. There is an increased likelihood that lifestyle \ntherapies and drug therapy will be started or con-\ntinued with significant, albeit modest, changes in \nrisk factor levels and predicted risk levels.\n8. Clinicians may need to address reducing ASCVD \nrisk in higher-risk primary-prevention patients \nwho either do not wish to take a statin or can-\nnot tolerate the recommended intensity of statin \ntherapy. In such patients, it may be reasonable to \nuse LDL-C–lowering drugs that have been proven \nsafe and effective in RCTs, either as monotherapy \nor combined with a statin.S4.4.2-9 One alternative \nis a cholesterol absorption inhibitor. An RCT in \nadults ≥40 years of age with advanced CKD and \nwithout known CHD at baseline found that the \naddition of ezetimibe to a moderate-intensity \nstatin lowered LDL-C 43 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) \nat 1 year.S4.4.2-54 After a median 4.9 years, ezeti-\nmibe and simvastatin 40 mg per day resulted in \na 17% proportional reduction in major athero-\nsclerotic events compared with placebo.S4.4.2-2 \nAnother alternative is a nonsystemic bile acid \nsequestrant. Bile acid sequestrants used as mono-\ntherapy reduced CHD endpoints in a large pri-\nmary-prevention trial.S4.4.2-55 Bile acid sequestrants \ncan bind other drugs, so other medications must \nbe avoided for 1 hour before and at least 3 to \n4 hours after administration. Adding psyllium \ncan minimize constipation and can reduce the \nbile acid sequestrant dose.S4.4.2-56 These therapies \nshould be considered in the context of a risk dis-\ncussion that reviews potential for benefit along \nwith tolerability and safety issues.\n9. Benefit from statin therapy is seen in lower-risk \nindividuals.S4.4.2-24 Consideration of enhancing factors in selected younger individuals in this \nlower risk range, will improve the ability to detect \nyounger patients who develop MI before age 50 \nyears.S4.4.2-58,S4.4.2-59 Nonetheless, the challenge \namong those in a lower ASCVD risk category is to \ninclude those who would benefit yet avoid cast-\ning too wide a net, to minimize treating those \nwho would derive little benefit from statin assign-\nment. This risk group benefits greatly from a clini-\ncian–patient risk discussion. To arrive at a shared \nrisk decision, clinicians should assess the patient’s \npriorities for health care, perceived ASCVD risk, \nand prior risk-reduction experiences and should \nuse best practices to communicate numerical \nrisk.S4.4.2-27 The presence of risk-enhancing fac-\ntors provides useful information about short term \nASCVD risk favoring initiation of statin therapy \n(Table 6).S4.4.2-58 Although a CAC score can be use-\nful in selected individuals, it will be positive less \noften in this lower-risk group than in those with \nhigher levels of ASCVD risk and is not recom-\nmended routinely.S4.4.2-17\n4.4.3.

Goals for LDL-C lowering in response to life-\nstyle therapies or a prescribed intensity of statin \ntherapy are defined by percentage responses. \nClinical efficacy is monitored by measurement of \npercentage reductions in LDL-C relative to base-\nline levels. Baseline LDL-C can be estimated by \npretreatment measurements, chart reviews, or \nmeasurement after a short interruption of drug \ntherapy. Some clinicians are reluctant to interrupt \ntherapy, although risk is low. Unless a baseline \nlevel is established, it will be difficult to evaluate \nresponse to therapy. Good adherence to various \nLDL-lowering diets will reduce LDL-C levels by \n10% to >15%.S4.4.3-3 Moderate-intensity statins \ncan be expected to reduce LDL-C levels by another \n30% to 49%, and high-intensity statins by ≥50% \nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nGrundy et al 2018 Cholesterol Clinical Practice Guidelines\nCirculation. 2019;139:e1082–e1143.

In some patients, the aggregate risks \nassociated with statins may exceed their likely benefits. \nLimited life spans may also undercut the minimum time \nfor likely statin benefits, especially the 4 to 5 years as-\nsociated with statins’ stroke-reducing benefits.S4.4.4.1-15 \nDecisions to not initiate statins, or even to depre-\nscribe them, are reasonable in older adults when  \naggregate risks outweigh potential for meaningful  \nbenefit.S4.4.4.1-9,S4.4.4.1-16–S4.4.4.1-18 A shared decision-making \nprocess between clinicians and patients that targets \nindividualized decisions is warranted, with regular reas-\nsessments over time. CAC determinationS4.4.4.1-10,S4.4.4.1-11 \nfocuses statin therapy on those who benefit most.

An RCT enrolling 5 084 men and women 70 to \n82 years of age showed no benefit from pravas-\ntatin 40 mg/d versus placebo in the primary-\nprevention subgroup.S4.4.4.1-12 Another RCT using \npravastatin 40 mg per day versus usual care in \nolder adults showed no statin benefitS4.4.4.1-19 \nbut there were important concerns about both \nadherence in those assigned to pravastatin \nand drop-in statin therapy in those assigned to \nusual care.S4.4.4.1-1,S4.4.4.1-2,S4.4.4.1-4 A recent meta-\nanalysisS4.4.4.1-3 combining data from JUPITER \nand HOPE-3 in those ≥70 years of age showed \na statistically significant 26% RRR for nonfa-\ntal MI, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. \nA prospective cohort studyS4.4.4.1-5 comparing \nhealthy older patients (age ≥70 years) who used \nstatins with those who did not showed signifi-\ncantly lower risk of death but nonsignificant car -\ndiovascular event reduction in the statin group. \nOther recent meta-analysesS4.4.4.1-6–S4.4.4.1-8 support \nprimary prevention for adults in their 70s. Thus, \nclinician–patient discussion of risk versus benefit \nremains particularly important with inconsistent \nsupport and few data for adults >80 years of \nage. Even a small increase in geriatric-specific \nadverse effects with statins could offset any car -\ndiovascular benefit.S4.4.4.1-20 Statins may be indi-\ncated if, after a clinician–patient discussion, the \npotential for benefit is thought to outweigh the \nrisks of adverse effects, drug–drug interactions, \nand cost.\n2.

Aggregate \nrisks increase with age and may become dis-\nproportionate to the extent that risks outweigh \npotential for meaningful benefit.

Moreover, given the predictable fluc-\ntuations of health dynamics, such shared decisions \nshould be reconsidered regularly.\n3. Multiple studies indicate the utility of CAC mea-\nsurement in identifying the absence of atheroscle-\nrotic pathophysiology in older adultsS4.4.4.1-10,S4.4.4.1-11  \nMoreover, with reduced costs, the long-term con-\nsequences of using low-dose computed tomogra-\nphy for CAC screening are much less concerning \nfor older patients. If CAC score is zero, the patient \nmay be reclassified to a lower-risk status to avoid \nstatin therapy.S4.4.4.1-11The BioImage study also \nindicated that scanning for carotid plaque did \nnot down-classify as many individuals as did a \nCAC score of zero but still improved specificity of \nstatin assignment.S4.4.4.1-11 Limiting statin therapy \nto those with CAC scores greater than zero, com-\nbined with clinical judgment and patient prefer -\nence, could provide a valuable awareness with \nwhich to inform shared decision-making.\n4.4.4.2.

In children or adolescents, atherosclerosis \nmay begin to appear in those with hypercholesterol-\nemia; in this age range, more aggressive cholesterol-\nlowering may be indicated.

In children and adolescents with  \na family history of either early CVD* or  \nsignificant hypercholesterolemia,† it is  \nreasonable to measure a fasting or nonfasting  \nlipoprotein profile as early as age 2 years  \nto detect FH or rare forms of  \nhypercholesterolemia.S4.4.4.3-17–S4.4.4.3-21\nIIa B-NR5.  In children and adolescents found to have \nmoderate or severe hypercholesterolemia, \nit is reasonable to carry out reverse-cascade \nscreening of family members, which includes \ncholesterol testing for first-, second-, and \nwhen possible, third-degree biological \nrelatives, for detection of familial forms of hy\npercholesterolemia.S4.4.4.3-22–S4.4.4.3-24\nIIa C-LD6.  In children and adolescents with obesity or \nother metabolic risk factors, it is reasonable \nto measure a fasting lipid profile to detect \nlipid disorders as components of the \nmetabolic syndrome.S4.4.4.3-25–S4.4.4.3-27\nIIb B-NR7.  In children and adolescents without \ncardiovascular risk factors or family history of \nearly CVD, it may be reasonable to measure a \nfasting lipid profile or nonfasting non HDL-C \nonce between the ages of 9 and 11 years, \nand again between the ages of 17 and 21 \nyears, to detect moderate to severe lipid \nabnormalities.S4.4.4.3-19,S4.4.4.3-21,S4.4.4.3-27–S4.4.4.3-29\n*Family history of early CVD is defined here as MI, documented angina, or \natherosclerosis by angiography in parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, or \nuncles (<55 years of age for men, <65 years of age for women).\n†TC ≥240 mg/dL (≥6.2 mmol/L), LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (≥4.9 \nmmol/L), non–HDL-C ≥220 mg/dL (≥5.7 mmol/L), or known primary \nhypercholesterolemia.\nSynopsis\nAbnormal lipid levels are relatively common in chil-\ndren and adolescents, affecting approximately 1 in 5 \nadolescents.S4.4.4.3-25 Confirmed lipid disorders are less \ncommon but occur frequently in the presence of obe-\nsity, often accompanied by cardiovascular risk factors, \nand contribute to increased rates of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity and mortality. Severe hypercholes-\nterolemia (LDL ≥190 mg/dL (≥4.9 mmol/L)) affects ~1 in \n250 children and adolescents. Testing for lipid disorders \ncan identify both severe hypercholesterolemia and mul-\ntifactorial lifestyle-related dyslipidemia. Nonfasting lipid \ntesting is effective for initial screening purposes, and \nnon–HDL-C is a reasonable screening test. No available \nevidence evaluates benefits of childhood lipid screen-\ning for modifying CVD events or associated long-term \nharm. However, significantly abnormal lipid levels track \nfrom childhood to adulthood. Furthermore, subclinical \natherosclerosis, as measured by carotid intima-media \nthickness, is abnormal in children with FH. Strong evi-\ndence shows that lifestyle modification improves lipid \nlevels in childhood without adverse effects on growth \nand maturation; however, effect sizes are small, and \nadherence may wane over time. Statins and nonstatins \nlower TC and LDL-C with minimal adverse effects in \nchildren and adolescents with severe hypercholesterol-\nemia. There are scant data on pharmacological treat-\nment of multifactorial lifestyle-related dyslipidemia.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. In children and adolescents with lipid abnor -\nmalities and obesity, lifestyle-modification ther -\napy should be intensified over and above usual \ntherapy for childhood obesity and should include \nmoderate caloric restriction and sufficient physi-\ncal activity (eg, 30-60 minutes of moderate to \nvigorous activity on most days). Utilization of \nresources for nutritional education and counsel-\ning is encouraged.\n2. Lifestyle-modification interventions in childhood \nand adolescence show short- and long-term \nbenefits to lipid levels and subclinical atheroscle-\nrosis measures in RCTsS4.4.4.3-5–S4.4.4.3-8 and obser -\nvational studies of children and adolescents \nwith lipid disorders.S4.4.4.3-3,S4.4.4.3-9 No adverse \neffects on growth or maturation have been \ndemonstrated.S4.4.4.3-6 The impact of these inter -\nventions on lipid levels and subclinical atheroscle-\nrosis is small; no studies report CVD event rates. \nThere are likely other unmeasured health benefits \nof lifestyle-modification interventions for chronic \ndisease outcomes (eg, obesity, diabetes mellitus, \nand cancer). These benefits support the recom-\nmendation to treat children and adolescents with \nlipid disorders with lifestyle-modification interven-\ntions, generally by using a family-based approach \nand promoting a heart-healthy diet, plenty of \nphysical activity, avoidance of cigarette smoking, \nmaintenance of a healthy weight, maintenance of \nnormal blood pressure, and maintenance of nor -\nmal glycemia.\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nGrundy et al 2018 Cholesterol Clinical Practice Guidelines\nJune 18/25, 2019 Circulation. 2019;139:e1082–e1143.

Statins and nonstatins lower TC and LDL-C in chil-\ndren and adolescents with FH,S4.4.4.3-30 and other \nhealth conditions that put them at increased \nrisk of CVD.S4.4.4.3-31,S4.4.4.3-32 Evidence from these \nRCTs demonstrates low short- and medium-term \nadverse event rates (abnormalities in liver func-\ntion test, creatine kinase [CK] levels, and reported \nmyopathy) with statin use in children and ado-\nlescents with FH.S4.4.4.3-30 Limited data show ben-\nefit from statins to subclinical atherosclerosis \nin FH. These data, coupled with the increased \nrisk of CVD in untreated severe hypercholester -\nolemia, support the use of statins in children \nand adolescents at ages ≥10 years who have  \nFHS4.4.4.3-33,S4.4.4.3-34 and have not responded to 3 \nto 6 months of lifestyle therapy. Statins may be \nconsidered at age 8 years in the presence of con-\ncerning family history, extremely elevated LDL-C \nlevel, or elevated Lp(a), in the context of informed \nshared decision-making and counseling with the \npatient and family. The intensity of treatment \nshould be based on the severity of the hyper -\ncholesterolemia and should incorporate patient/\nfamily preference. Scant data on the use of ezeti-\nmibe in children with severe hypercholesterolemia \nshow reasonable LDL-C lowering with no signifi-\ncant adverse effects.S4.4.4.3-13 Nonsystemic bile acid \nsequestrants can be useful for LDL-C lowering, \nbut tolerability is an issue.S4.4.4.3-13–S4.4.4.3-16\n4. Lipid testing during childhood can identify the \nsevere hypercholesterolemia phenotype.S4.4.4.3-35 \nSevere hypercholesterolemia, which includes FH, \ncan be identified in children and adolescents \nwith an LDL-C level ≥190 mg/dL (≥4.9 mmol/L). \nMoreover, children and adolescents with LDL-C \n≥160 mg/dL (≥4.1 mmol/L) and a family history \nof early atherosclerosis or similarly elevated cho-\nlesterol in 1 parent likely are those with FH and \nrelated genetic disorders associated with accel-\nerated ASCVD.S4.4.4.3-17–S4.4.4.3-21 Subclinical ath-\nerosclerosis data suggest divergence between \naffected and unaffected children and adolescents \nbeginning at age 10 years,S4.4.4.3-28 which sup-\nports screening by this age, although this topic \nis still considered controversial.S4.4.4.3-36 Screening \nis advised beginning at age 2 years if a family his-\ntory is suggestive of either early CVD or significant \nprimary hypercholesterolemia. Identification of \na child with severe hypercholesterolemia should \nprompt screening of extended family members \n(eg, reverse-cascade screening), according to \nstudies outside the United States demonstrating \nefficacy of this approach.S4.4.4.3-37 Screening for \nsevere hypercholesterolemia on the basis of fam-\nily history includes an expanded group of family \nmembers (eg, grandparents, aunts, and uncles) in addition to parents and siblings because siblings \nof children are unlikely to have had cardiovascular \nevents or been identified with significant choles-\nterol disorders.S4.4.4.3-38\n5. One advantage of measuring lipids in children \nand adolescents is to identify genetic abnormali-\nties in lipid metabolism that may be present in \nother family members. Regardless of the age at \nwhich abnormalities are detected, reverse-cas-\ncade screening in families is highly effective for \nthe identification of family members at risk of \nASCVD.S4.4.4.3-22–S4.4.4.3-24\n6. Observational studies of children and adolescents \nshow that obesity and other lifestyle-related \nbehaviors and metabolic syndrome risk fac-\ntors including lipid abnormalities,S4.4.4.3-25,S4.4.4.3-26 \nand with subclinical atherosclerosis into young \nadulthood,S4.4.4.3-38,S4.4.4.3-39 occur at higher rates \nthan in lean and otherwise healthy children and \nadolescents. Longitudinal cohort data show mod-\nerate tracking of cardiovascular risk factors from \nchildhood to adulthood in the general pediatric \npopulation,S4.4.4.3-40 suggesting some persistence \nof the underlying pathophysiology and potential \nbenefit of identifying lipid disorders in childhood.\n7.

In the former, excess triglycerides are carried \nin VLDL. In the latter, most patients have elevated VLDL \nplus chylomicrons. VLDL are believed to be atherogenic, \nsimilar to LDL. There are many causes of elevated VLDL, \nand it is reasonable to reduce their levels to reduce risk \nof ASCVD. With severe hypertriglyceridemia, elevations \nof VLDL raise risk of ASCVD, but increases in chylomi-\ncrons impart risk of acute pancreatitis.

Clinicians should consider conditions specific \nto women, such as premature menopause \n(age <40 years) and history of pregnancy-\nassociated disorders (hypertension, \npreeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, \nsmall-for-gestational-age infants, preterm \ndeliveries), when discussing lifestyle \nintervention and the potential for benefit of \nstatin therapy.S4.5.3-1–S4.5.3-6\nI C-LD2.  Women of childbearing age who are treated \nwith statin therapy and are sexually active \nshould be counseled to use a reliable form of \ncontraception.S4.5.3-7–S4.5.3-12\nI C-LD3.  Women of childbearing age with \nhypercholesterolemia who plan to become \npregnant should stop the statin 1 to 2 \nmonths before pregnancy is attempted, or \nif they become pregnant while on a statin, \nshould have the statin stopped as soon as \nthe pregnancy is discovered.S4.5.3-7–S4.5.3-12\nSynopsis\nAlthough atherosclerosis typically occurs later in wom-\nen than in men, CVD remains the leading cause of \ndeath in women. Statins clearly reduce ASCVD events \nin women as well as in men with ASCVD. The 2015 \nmeta-analysis by the CTT Collaboration showed no \nheterogeneity by gender for the risk of major vascular \nevents with statin therapy in participants with a history \nof vascular disease.S4.5.3-13 A history of certain pregnan-\ncy-related conditions and premature menopause (age \n<40 years) have been associated with increased ASCVD \nrisk. However, current best practice emphasizes that \nstatins should not be taken during pregnancy. Thus, \nwomen of childbearing age who are on statin therapy \nand are sexually active should use a reliable form of \ncontraception to avoid pregnancy. When pregnancy \nis planned, stopping statin therapy 1 to 2 months be-\nfore pregnancy is attempted is suggested as reason-\nable guidance. When an unplanned pregnancy occurs, \nstatins should be stopped immediately when the preg-nancy is  discovered. Both cholesterol and triglycerides \nrise with pregnancy, and those with genetic lipid dis-\norders should consider consulting a clinician with lipid \nexpertise before starting the pregnancy.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. Several conditions specific to women (eg, hyper -\ntensive disorders during pregnancy, preeclampsia, \ngestational diabetes mellitus, delivering a preterm \nor low-birth-weight infant,S4.5.3-2–S4.5.3-4 and prema-\nture menopause [age <40 years]S4.5.3-5,S4.5.3-6,S4.5.3-14)  \nhave been shown to increase ASCVD risk. The \npresent guideline includes preeclampsia and \npremature menopause (age <40 years) as risk-\nenhancing factors for statin therapy because they \nappear to increase ASCVD risk in the same range \nas other risk-enhancing factors. On the other \nhand, the mechanism or cause of preterm birth \nis often unknown; therefore, it is difficult to rou-\ntinely include this condition as a risk-enhancing \nfactor for statin therapy. Furthermore, if gesta-\ntional diabetes mellitus predisposes a woman to \nmetabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus, these \nare already identified as risk-enhancing or major \nASCVD risk factors. After pregnancy and through-\nout the life course of every woman, a thorough \npregnancy history should be obtained, and risk \nfactors and risk-enhancing factors should be \nidentified. Interventions should include aggres-\nsive lifestyle counseling to reduce ASCVD risk and \nwhen appropriate, statin therapy, if ASCVD risk \nestimation indicates that the potential for benefit \nfrom statin therapy outweighs the potential for \nadverse effects. Decisions should be made in the \ncontext of a risk discussion and should take into \nconsideration an informed patient preference.\n2. All statins are currently contraindicated in pregnant \nwomen, primarily as a result of a 2004 series of \ncases of first-trimester statin exposure reported to \nthe FDA, which showed 20 cases of malformation, \nincluding 5 severe defects of the central nervous \nsystem and 5 unilateral limb deficiencies.S4.5.3-7 In \nall cases of adverse birth outcomes, the statin used \nwas lipophilic. No malformation was identified in \nthe 14 infants exposed to pravastatin (hydrophilic). \nSince this case series, cohort studies of statin expo-\nsure in pregnancy did not show an increase in \nteratogenic risk,S4.5.3-8–S4.5.3-10 and in fact, the safety \nof pravastatin is under study for the prevention of \npreeclampsia in high-risk pregnant women.S4.5.3-15 \nIn a meta-analysis of 6 studies of pregnant women \nexposed to statins, no increased risk of birth \ndefects was observed compared with control \nsubjects.

A reasonable approach is to stop statins 1 to 2 \nmonths before pregnancy is attempted. When \npregnancy is unplanned, statin therapy should \nbe stopped promptly and not restarted until after \npregnancy and breastfeeding are completed. \nCholesterol levels rise in pregnancy, with a similar \npercentage rise in normal women and those with \nheterozygous FH. Women with FH do not appear to \nhave a higher risk of preterm delivery or of having \ninfants with low birth weight or congenital malfor -\nmations than unaffected women, but undetected \nbias cannot be ruled out.S4.5.3-16 An experienced \nlipid specialist should be consulted for women with \nhomozygous FH whose care is beyond the scope \nof the present guideline. Also, triglyceride levels \nrise progressively with each trimester, and women \nwith triglyceride levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) \nat the onset of pregnancy may develop severe \nhypertriglyceridemia during the third trimester of \npregnancy, which can lead to pancreatitis.S4.5.3-17 \nAdvising patients on lifestyle (including both diet \nand physical activity), optimally managing diseases \nlike diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism, and \nchoosing medications that are less likely to raise tri-\nglycerides can reduce levels of triglycerides before \npregnancy begins. Treatment of severe hypertri-\nglyceridemic pregnancy is also beyond the scope \nof the present guideline and requires consultation \nwith an experienced lipid specialist.\n4.5.4.

In risk dis-\ncussion with intermediate-risk patients, the presence of \nCKD favors initiation of statin therapy. In adults with \nadvanced kidney disease requiring dialysis treatment \nwho are currently on pharmacological LDL-lowering \ntherapy with a statin, it may be reasonable to continue \nthe statin.S4.5.4-2 In adults with CKD that requires dialysis \ntreatment, initiation of a statin is not recommended on \nthe basis of 2 large-scale RCTs.S4.5.4-3,S4.5.4-4\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. Reduced eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 not on dialy-\nsis) and presence of albuminuria (albumin-to-\ncreatinine ratio ≥30 mcg/mg) are independently \nassociated with elevated risk of ASCVD. Hence, in \nintermediate-risk patients, CKD counts as a risk-\nenhancing factor. According to some studies,S4.5.4-5 \nthe cardiovascular risk for persons with reduced \neGFR may be as high as that observed among \npatients with diabetes mellitus and no CKD. \nPresence of albuminuria with reduced eGFR \nmultiplies this CVD risk. The risk is graded and \nincreases with severity of eGFR impairment, with \nobserved threshold of risk beginning around 75 \nmL/min/1.73 m2, whereas the risk associated \nwith albuminuria is linear.S4.5.4-6 Trials show abso-\nlute benefit from statin use, and this benefit is \nconsistent across eGFR stages. However, the RRR \nper LDL-C–lowering may be lower with more \nadvanced CKD. Albuminuria is independently \nassociated with CVD risk. However, the one trial \ndone for primary prevention in persons with albu-\nminuria and preserved eGFR had too few events \nto be conclusive.S4.5.4-7\n2. According to this recommendation, in patients \nwith CKD who are currently taking a statin, it \nmay be reasonable to continue the statin. In sup-\nport of this, in the SHARP trial (Study of Heart \nand Renal Protection) (simvastatin plus ezetimibe \nversus placebo), >30% of persons transitioned to \ndialysis.S4.5.4-2 After weighting for subgroup-spe-\ncific reductions in LDL-C was performed, the pro-\nportional effects on major atherosclerotic events \nwere similar in patients on dialysis and those who \nwere not on dialysis.\n3. Although persons on dialysis have the high-\nest absolute risk of events (and thus poten-\ntial for higher ARR), the proportion of deaths \nthought to be due to atherosclerotic events is  \nlower.S4.5.4-3,S4.5.4-4 The lack of benefit in RCTs with \nstatin initiation among persons on dialysis raises the \nquestion of competing risks.

In adults 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C \n70 to 189 mg/dL (1.7 to 4.8 mmol/L) who \nhave a 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5% or \nhigher, chronic inflammatory disorders \nand HIV are risk-enhancing factors and in \nrisk discussion favor moderate-intensity \nstatin therapy or high-intensity statin \ntherapy.S4.5.5-1–S4.5.5-12\nIIa B-NR2.  In patients with chronic inflammatory \ndisorders or HIV, a fasting lipid profile and \nassessment of ASCVD risk factors can be \nuseful as a) a guide to benefit of statin \ntherapy and b) for monitoring or adjusting \nlipid-lowering drug therapy before and 4 \nto 12 weeks after starting inflammatory \ndisease–modifying therapy or antiretroviral \ntherapy.S4.5.5-12–S4.5.5-20\nIIa B-NR3.  In adults with RA who undergo ASCVD \nrisk assessment with measurement of a \nlipid profile, it can be useful to recheck \nlipid values and other major ASCVD \nrisk factors 2 to 4 months after the \npatient’s inflammatory disease has been \ncontrolled.S4.5.5-21–S4.5.5-23\nSynopsis\nChronic inflammatory disorders and HIV infection are \nconditions that often enhance risk. Clinicians should \nfirst focus on helping patients with these diagnoses to \noptimize their lifestyle habits. After a 3- to 6-month \ntrial of lifestyle improvements, including cessation of \ncigarette smoking, the patient’s 10-year ASCVD risk \nestimate should be reassessed. If the patient’s ASCVD \nrisk estimate is ≥5% over 10 years, it is reasonable \nto begin moderate-intensity statin therapy. If the pa-\ntient or clinician remains uncertain about the need \nfor statin therapy or if the patient has had side effects \nwith a statin in the past, a CAC scan can be used to \nimprove risk assessment. The absence of CAC in a \nnonsmoking man ≥40 years of age or a nonsmoking \nwoman ≥45 years of age would indicate that the pa-\ntient is likely at very low risk of an ASCVD event over \nthe subsequent decade. Such patients can then focus \non lifestyle habits and delay the decision about statin \ntherapy for about 5 years. Similarly, a CAC score \n≥75th percentile for a patient’s age and sex or an ab-\nsolute score ≥100 Agatston units would support the \ndecision to use statin therapy and intensify lifestyle \nmodifications.Recommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. Inflammation promotes atherosclerosis and is a \nkey feature of many chronic rheumatologic inflam-\nmatory joint disorders, such systemic lupus ery-\nthematosus, RA, and psoriasis.S4.5.5-1 Inflammation \nmediates the progression of atherosclerosis, as \nwell as instability, erosion, and rupture of vulnera-\nble atherosclerotic plaques.S4.5.5-2 Among individu-\nals with RA, the risk of an MI has been estimated \nto be similar to that of an adult with diabetes mel-\nlitus or one who is about 10 years older without \nRA.S4.5.5-3 A large meta-analysis found that persons \nwith RA had an approximately 50% increased \nrisk of CVD death.S4.5.5-4 Individuals with systemic \nlupus erythematosus and advanced psoriasis have \na similarly increased risk of CVD.S4.5.5-5–S4.5.5-7 HIV \ninfection is associated with an increased risk of \nan ASCVD event even if viremia has been con-\ntrolled by antiretroviral therapy.S4.5.5-8 There is an \nincreased risk of MI in association with long-term \nuse of antiretroviral therapy, and MI rates are \nincreased in individuals with HIV.S4.5.5-9 Traditional \nASCVD risk factors, long-term use of antiret-\nroviral therapy, prolonged immune activation, \nand inflammation are mediators of atheroscle-\nrosis progression and development.S4.5.5-9,S4.5.5-10 \nCoinfection with hepatitis C virus is frequently \npresent in HIV-infected individuals and further \nincreases ASCVD risk.S4.5.5-11,S4.5.5-12\n2.

A clinician–patient risk discussion is \nrecommended before initiation of statin \ntherapy to review net clinical benefit, weighing \nthe potential for ASCVD risk reduction against \nthe potential for statin-associated side effects, \nstatin–drug interactions, and safety, while \nemphasizing that side effects can be addressed \nsuccessfully.S5-1–S5-7\nI A2.  In patients with statin-associated muscle \nsymptoms (SAMS), a thorough assessment \nof symptoms is recommended, in addition \nto an evaluation for nonstatin causes and \npredisposing factors.S5-3–S5-7\nI B-R3.  In patients with indication for statin therapy, \nidentification of potential predisposing \nfactors for statin-associated side effects, \nincluding new-onset diabetes mellitus and \nSAMS, is recommended before initiation of \ntreatment.S5-3–S5-7\nI B-R4.  In patients with statin-associated side effects \nthat are not severe, it is recommended \nto reassess and to rechallenge to achieve \na maximal LDL-C lowering by modified \ndosing regimen, an alternate statin or in \ncombination with nonstatin therapy.S5-3–S5-8\nI B-R5.  In patients with increased diabetes mellitus \nrisk or new-onset diabetes mellitus, it is \nrecommended to continue statin therapy, \nwith added emphasis on adherence, net \nclinical benefit, and the core principles of \nregular moderate-intensity physical activity, \nmaintaining a healthy dietary pattern, and \nsustaining modest weight loss.S5-8–S5-12I C-LD6.  In patients treated with statins, it is \nrecommended to measure creatine kinase \nlevels in individuals with severe statin-\nassociated muscle symptoms, objective \nmuscle weakness, and to measure liver \ntransaminases (aspartate aminotransferase, \nalanine aminotransferase) as well as total \nbilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (hepatic \npanel) if there are symptoms suggesting \nhepatotoxicity.S5-13–S5-15\nI B-R7.  In patients at increased ASCVD risk with \nchronic, stable liver disease (including \nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease) when \nappropriately indicated, it is reasonable \nto use statins after obtaining baseline \nmeasurements and determining a schedule \nof monitoring and safety checks.S5-16–S5-18\nIIa B-R8.  In patients at increased ASCVD risk with \nsevere statin-associated muscle symptoms or \nrecurrent statin-associated muscle symptoms \ndespite appropriate statin rechallenge, it \nis reasonable to use RCT proven nonstatin \ntherapy that is likely to provide net clinical \nbenefit.S5-5,S5-6,S5-19\nIII: No \nBenefitB-R9.  Coenzyme Q10 is not recommended for \nroutine use in patients treated with statins or \nfor the treatment of SAMS.S5-20,S5-21\nIII: No \nBenefitC-LD10.  In patients treated with statins, routine \nmeasurements of creatine kinase and \ntransaminase levels are not useful.S5-13–S5-15\nSynopsis\nStatin therapy is usually well tolerated and safe.S5-1,S5-14,  \nS5-22–S5-24 As with other classes of medications, associ-\nated side effects are seen. Instead of the label statin \nintolerance, the present guideline prefers statin-associ-\nated side effects because the large majority of patients \nare able to tolerate statin rechallenge with an alterna-\ntive statin or alternative regimen, such as reduced dose \nor in combination with nonstatins. Although infrequent \nor rare in clinical trials, statin-associated side effects \ncan be challenging to assess and manage.S5-25,S5-26 The \nmost frequent are SAMS. SAMS usually are subjective \nmyalgia, reported observationally in 5% to 20% of \npatients.S5-11–S5-14 SAMS often result in nonadherence \nand can adversely impact ASCVD outcomes.S5-27–S5-29 \nStatins modestly increase risk of incident diabetes mel-\nlitus in susceptible individuals,S5-8–S5-11 but this should \nnot be cause for discontinuation (Table 11). The present \nguideline recommends a comprehensive approach to \nstatin-associated symptoms. The clinician should reas-\nsess, rediscuss, and encourage rechallenge as the ini-\ntial approach unless side effects are severe. Ongoing \ncommunication is integral to patient care, as is regular \nmonitoring to check for adherence, adequacy of re-\nsponse, new associated symptoms, and reaffirmation \nof benefit.S5-2Recommendations for Statin Safety and Statin-Associated Side \nEffects (Continued)\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nJune 18/25, 2019 Circulation. 2019;139:e1082–e1143.

Rhabdomyolysis (CK >10 times upper limit \nof normal, with evidence of renal injury) is exceed-\ningly rare and usually encountered in the setting of \na patient with several predisposing comorbidities \nand concomitant high-risk medications.S5-1,S5-22,S5-30 \nIt requires immediate medical attention.\n3. Before lipid-lowering therapy with a statin is \ninitiated, a comprehensive evaluation of mus-\nculoskeletal symptoms (with documentation) is rec-\nommended because such symptoms are common \nat baseline in the general adult population.S5-3–S5-6 \nBefore therapy, it is also important to identify predis-\nposing factors for SAMS, including demographics, \ncomorbid conditions, and use of medications that \ncan adversely affect statin metabolismS5-3,S5-13,S5-14  \n(Table 11). Proactive and preemptive identification \nof patients at potential increased risk of statin-\nassociated side effects should help guide informed \nclinical decision-making and is supportive of the \ngoals of safe and effective therapy.\n4. Several creatively designed randomized crossover \ntrials in patients with SAMSS5-3–S5-7 support a man-\nagement strategy of statin discontinuation until \nsymptoms improve, followed by rechallenge with \na reduced dose, alternative agent, or alternative \ndosing regimen while monitoring for recurrent \nsymptoms. If the approach of reassess, rediscuss \n(net clinical benefit), and rechallenge is used, a \nmajority of patients will be able to be successfully \ntreated with at least one or several statins.S5-29,S5-31 \nIn patients at increased ASCVD risk, the goal should \nbe to treat with the guideline-recommended max-\nimally tolerated statin dose. Patients who experi-\nence rhabdomyolysis with statin therapy may need \nto discontinue statin use indefinitely, although \nreversible causes should be sought.S5-32 Clinicians \nshould be aware of a rare disorder, statin-associ-\nated autoimmune myopathy (muscle weakness, \nmarked and persistent CK elevation, presence \nof HMG CoA reductase [HMGCR] antibodies, \nnecrotizing myopathy, and lack of or incomplete \nresolution on statin discontinuation), that requires \nstatin cessation and additional therapy directed at \nthe autoimmune process.S5-32 Patients with statin-\nassociated autoimmune myopathy may benefit \nfrom seeing a neurologist specializing in neuro-\nmuscular disorders.\n5. Evidence indicates that statins modestly increase \nthe risk of incident or statin-associated new-onset \ndiabetes mellitus in individuals with predisposing \nrisk factors for diabetes mellitus, components of \nthe metabolic syndrome, and higher-intensity statin \nuse.S5-8–S5-11 The specific mechanisms leading to statin-associated diabetes mellitus remain unclear, \nalthough it is unlikely that statins directly cause \ndiabetes mellitus. Rather, it appears that a small \nnumber of individuals with diabetic susceptibility \ncross the threshold to incident diabetes mellitus \nafter statin therapy. is initiated It is important that \npatients are informed of the potential risk of new-\nonset diabetes mellitus before initiation of statin \ntherapy. Because the benefits of statin therapy are \nshown to outweigh the risks of new-onset diabetes \nmellitus, the possibility of incident diabetes mellitus \nshould not be a contraindication to statin therapy \nor indication for statin discontinuation.S5-8,S5-14,S5-33 \nIn individuals at increased risk of both ASCVD and \nincident diabetes mellitus, it is recommended that \ncounseling based on the ADA prevention approach \nbe provided. This approach encourages regular \nmoderate physical activity, maintaining a healthy \ndietary pattern, and sustaining modest weight loss \n(according to the core principles of the Diabetes \nPrevention Program).S5-12\n6. In patients with statin-associated side effects, it is \nrecommended that CK be measured in the case of \nsevere SAMS and in the presence of objective mus-\ncle weakness. After baseline liver transaminases, the \nFDA recommends measuring transaminases (aspar -\ntate aminotransferase [serum glutamic-oxaloacetic \ntransaminase] and alanine aminotransferase [serum \nglutamic-pyruvic transaminase]) if there are signs or \nsymptoms suggesting hepatotoxicity.S5-13–S5-15\n7. An asymptomatic increase in transaminases (>3 times \nupper limit of normal) is an infrequent statin-associ-\nated side effect that often resolves with dose reduc-\ntion or rechallenge with alternative statins.S5-1,S5-22  \nSevere statin-associated hepatotoxicity is rare, and \nthe incidence is not impacted by routine monitor -\ning of transaminases.S5-34 A thorough evaluation \nfor nonstatin etiologies is warranted when signifi-\ncant transaminase elevation persists. Importantly, \nstatins are not contraindicated in patients with \nincreased ASCVD risk with chronic, stable liver dis-\nease (eg, nonalcoholic fatty liver), and limited data \nsuggest potential benefit.S5-16–S5-18\n8. Severe statin-associated side effects are rare, and \nrecurrent SAMS are infrequent when a thorough \nreassessment and management strategy of reas-\nsess, rediscuss, and rechallenge is used. In patients \nat increased ASCVD risk with severe statin-asso-\nciated side effects or recurrent SAMS, nonstatin \ntherapy should be considered when there is net \nclinical benefit.S5-5,S5-6,S5-19\n9.

IMPLEMENTATION\nRecommendations for Implementation\nReferenced studies that support recommendations are summarized \nin Online Data Supplements 42 to 46.\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nI A1.  Interventions focused on improving \nadherence to prescribed therapy are \nrecommended for management of adults \nwith elevated cholesterol levels, including \ntelephone reminders, calendar reminders, \nintegrated multidisciplinary educational \nactivities, and pharmacist-led interventions, \nsuch as simplification of the drug regimen to \nonce-daily dosing.S6-1–S6-4\nI B-NR2.  Clinicians, health systems, and health \nplans should identify patients who are \nnot receiving guideline-directed medical \ntherapy and should facilitate the initiation \nof appropriate guideline-directed medical \ntherapy, using multifaceted strategies to \nimprove guideline implementation.S6-5,S6-6\nI B-NR3.  Before therapy is prescribed, a patient-\nclinician discussion should take place to \npromote shared decision-making and \nshould include the potential for ASCVD risk-\nreduction benefit, adverse effects, drug-drug \ninteractions, and patient preferences.S6-7,S6-8\nSynopsis\nGuideline publication does not guarantee guideline \nimplementation. Healthcare delivery is complex, and \nbarriers to guideline implementation can occur at the \npatient, clinician, health system, and health plan levels, \nleading to gaps in care. A more concerted effort, with \nmultifaceted strategies aimed at the patient, clinician, \nhealth system, and health plan, is needed to overcome \nthe barriers and achieve wider guideline implementa-\ntion (Table S7). The patient is a key player in success-\nful guideline implementation, and the clinician–patient \ndiscussion is crucial to the successful initiation and con-\ntinuation of guideline-directed management and thera-\npy (Table 7). As part of the clinician–patient discussion, \nthe patient should be encouraged to state what was heard, ask questions, express values and preferences, \nand state ability and willingness to adhere to lifestyle \nchanges and medications. This is where a discussion \nof out-of-pocket costs can occur. Clinicians should use \nmultiple interventions to promote adherence, including \nasking more specific questions about adherence, aim-\ning for once-daily dosing, using automated reminders, \nparticipating in multidisciplinary educational activities, \nand using pharmacist-led interventions.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive \nText\n1. Interventions focused on improving adherence to \nprescribed therapy are recommended for man-\nagement of adults with elevated cholesterol lev-\nels. A Cochrane systematic review demonstrated \nthat intensification of patient care interventions \nimproves both short- and long-term adherence \nto medication, as well as meaningful reduction \nin LDL-C levels. Interventions include telephone \nreminders, calendar reminders, integrated mul-\ntidisciplinary educational activities, simplification \nof the drug regimen to once-daily dosing, and \npharmacist-led interventions.S6-1–S6-4 Clinicians may \nwish to review Table S7 in the Web Supplement, \n“Strategies to Improve Guideline Implementation \nby Setting and Target Audience Measures to \nImprove Lipid Medication Adherence.”\n2.

Economic Value Considerations: \nPCSK9 Inhibitors\nACC/AHA clinical guidelines now recognize the im-\nportance of considering economic value in making \nrecommendations, in accordance with the principles \nestablished by an expert group.S7.1-1 PCSK9 inhibi-\ntors further reduce LDL-C when combined with other \nLDL-lowering drugs, and they reduced composite car -\ndiovascular events in 2 RCTs of high-risk, secondary-\nprevention patients with clinical ASCVD.S7.1-2 The cost-\neffectiveness and economic value of PCSK9 inhibitors \nhave been assessed by using simulation models (Online \nData Supplements 47 and 48); the published models \nare based on different sets of assumptions. Compared \nwith statin therapy for secondary prevention, PCSK9 \ninhibitors have incremental cost-effectiveness ratiosS7.1-3 \nfrom $141 700 to $450 000 per quality-adjusted life-\nyear (QALY) added, at mid-2018 list prices. None of the \npublished models report “good value” (<$50 000 per QALY added; Table 12), and virtually all indicate “low \nvalue” (≥$150 000 per QALY added). All models pro-\njected mortality benefit by assuming that mortality rate \nreductions either parallel LDL-C loweringS7.1-4 or parallel \nRRRs for nonfatal ASCVD events.\nAll models project higher lifetime cost from use of \nPCSK9 inhibitors because the cost will exceed any sav-\nings from prevention of cardiovascular events. To be \ncost-effective by conventional standards, the cost of \nPCSK9 inhibitors will have to be reduced on the order \nof 70% to 85% in the United States.S7.1-3 At any given \nprice, the economic value of PCSK9 inhibitors will be \nimproved by restricting their use to patients at very \nhigh-risk of ASCVD events, as recommended in the \npresent guidelines. The inverse relationship between \nimproved survival and the incremental cost-effective-\nness ratio (Figure 3) indicates that the economic val-\nue of PCSK9 inhibitors will be improved by selecting \nhigher-risk patients. One simulation model suggested \nthat restricting the use of PCSK9 inhibitor therapy to \npatients with baseline LDL-C levels ≥119 mg/dL (≥3 \nmmol/L), instead of ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L), would \nimprove their cost-effectiveness to $150 000 per QALY \nadded, instead of $268 000.S7.1-5 Another study pro-\njected a similar improvement in economic value.S7.1-6 \nThus, raising the threshold for LDL-C on maximal \nstatin therapy to initiate a PCSK9 inhibitor should im-\nprove its cost-effectiveness (Figure 3).\nOnly 2 economic models have specifically examined \nthe value provided by PCSK9 inhibitors for primary pre-\nvention in patients with heterozygous FH (Online Data \nSupplement 45). One modelS7.1-7 found low value when \nPCSK9 inhibitors were used for FH ($503 000 per QALY \nadded), whereas the second modelS7.1-8 reported inter -\nmediate value (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \n$75 900 per QALY added). Consequently, the value of \nPCSK9 inhibitor therapy in FH is uncertain.Table 12.

Randomized Controlled Trials\nACC/AHA guidelines are based largely on the outcomes \nof RCTs. Cholesterol guidelines have fortunately benefited \nfrom a large number of RCTs of cholesterol-lowering thera-\npies. They have established that greater reductions of LDL-\nC are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD. \nRobust RCTs exist for both primary and secondary preven-\ntion. Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with \nstatin therapy. Important limited data have also been ob-\ntained with nonstatins as add-on drugs to statin therapy. \nNevertheless, more data are needed to determine the full \nscope of the benefit of nonstatin drugs. Several important \nquestions need to be addressed by additional RCTs.\n1. In secondary prevention, does a lower limit for \nLDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incre-\nmental benefit attained is worth neither the risks \nnor the cost of additional therapy?\n2. In secondary prevention, what are the indications \nfor adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin \ntherapy?\n3. In patients with ASCVD who have statin-associ-\nated side effects, are PCSK9 inhibitors an effective \nand safe substitute for high-intensity statins?4. In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years \nof age (LDL-C <90 mg/dL [<2.3 mmol/L]) with or \nwithout diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental \nrisk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins \nas compared with moderate-intensity statins?\n5. In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of \nage (LDL-C <190 mg/dL [<4.9 mmol/L]) with or \nwithout diabetes mellitus, what is the incremen-\ntal risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity \nstatins plus ezetimibe as compared with moder -\nate-intensity statins alone?\n6. Is statin therapy efficacious and safe in older \npatients (>75 years of age)? If so, what is a net \nbenefit of statin therapy in this age group?\n7. In patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, what \nare the efficacy and net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors \nas add-on treatment to maximal statin therapy?\n8. What is the efficacy of moderate-intensity and \nhigh-intensity statin therapy in patients with risk-\nenhancing factors (eg, chronic inflammatory dis-\nease, CKD, metabolic syndrome)?\n8.2.

Although these equa-\ntions are useful, they may overestimate or underesti-\nmate risk for individual patients. For this reason, the \n2013 ACC/AHA guidelinesS8.2-1 introduced the clinician–\npatient risk discussion to facilitate clinical decisions \nabout appropriate therapy. In the present guidelines, \nthe clinician–patient risk discussion has been amplified \nand made an integral part of the clinical decision. In \naddition, in cases in which uncertainty exists, the mea-\nsurement of CAC has been proposed as a third step in \nmaking a treatment decision. Each of these steps could \nbe improved for future guidelines.\n8.2.1. Continuing Refinement of PCE\nBecause the population baseline risk may be continually \ndeclining in the US population, ongoing epidemiological \nstudy is needed to assess and update population risk. An \nexample is the development of QRISK in the U.K. popula-\ntion, which is continually expanding its scope.\n8.2.2. Improvement in Lifetime Risk Estimate\nThe present guidelines include a lifetime ASCVD risk al-\ngorithm for those 20 to 59 years of age, but it is based \non an insufficient database. Along with a risk algorithm \nfor short-term risk of ASCVD (eg, 10 years), a more \nrobust lifetime risk algorithm would facilitate the clini-\ncian–patient risk discussion for treatment decisions.\n8.2.3. Refinement of Clinician–Patient Risk \nDiscussion\nAn ongoing study of how a clinician can best interact \nwith a patient to arrive at an informed decision must be \ndone, taking multiple factors into consideration. This \nis particularly important because cholesterol-lowering \ntherapy is meant to be a lifetime therapy.\n8.2.4. Monitoring and Adjustment of Treatment\nThe clinician–patient risk discussion will likely prove in-\nadequate unless an ongoing interaction between the \npatient and clinician occurs. This involves monitoring \nthe effectiveness of therapy and adherence to therapy. \nThus, the clinician–patient risk discussion should in-\nclude more than the initial treatment decision. Ongoing \nresearch on how to improve the entire process of initial \ndecision-making and long-term follow-up is necessary.\n8.2.5. Prognostic Significance of CAC\nThe present guideline makes use of the available data \nto predict the risk associated with CAC. These data \nneed to be amplified by new and ongoing studies to \nguide treatment decisions. Particular uncertainty exists \nabout the predictive value of intermediate CAC scores. \nIn addition, the predictive significance of a CAC score \nof zero must be further verified in follow-up studies. For \npatients with a CAC score of zero, it is currently uncer -\ntain when and if follow-up CAC measurements should \nbe done to reassess risk status.ACC/AHA TASK FORCE MEMBERS\nGlenn N.

    "content": "), it is useful to categorize BP levels for clinical and public health decision making. In the present document, BP is categorized into 4 levels on the basis of average BP measured in a healthcare \nsetting (office pressures): normal, elevated, and stage 1 or 2 \nhypertension (Table 6). Online Data Supplement C illustrates \nschematically the SBP and DBP categories defining normal BP, elevated BP, and stages 1 and 2 hypertension. This cat-\negorization differs from that previously recommended in the JNC 7 report, with stage 1 hypertension now defined as \nan SBP of 130–139 or a DBP of 80–89 mm Hg, and with \nstage 2 hypertension in the present document corresponding \nto stages 1 and 2 in the JNC 7 report.\nS3.1-21 The rationale for \nthis categorization is based on observational data related to the association between SBP/DBP and CVD risk, RCTs of life-\nstyle modification to lower BP, and RCTs of treatment with \nantihypertensive medication to prevent CVD. The increased \nrisk of CVD among adults with stage 2 hypertension is well \nestablished. An increasing number of individual studies and \nmeta-analyses of observational data have reported a gradient \nof progressively higher CVD risk going from normal BP to \nelevated BP and stage 1 hypertension.\nS3.1-4–S3.1-10,S3.1-12,S3.1-13,S3.1-16 \nIn many of these meta-analyses, the hazard ratios for CHD and stroke were between 1.1 and 1.5 for the comparison of SBP/DBP of 120–129/80–84 mm Hg versus <120/80 mm Hg \nand between 1.5 and 2.0 for the comparison of SBP/DBP of \n130–139/85–89 mm Hg versus <120/80 mm Hg. This risk \ngradient was consistent across subgroups defined by sex and \nrace/ethnicity. The relative increase in CVD risk associated \nwith higher BP was attenuated but still present among older \nadults.\nS3.1-1 The prevalence of severe hypertension has been \ndeclining over time, but approximately 12.3% of US adults with hypertension have an average SBP ≥160 mm Hg or aver -\nage DBP ≥100 mm Hg.\nS3.1-22 Lifestyle modification and phar -\nmacological antihypertensive treatment recommendations for individuals with elevated BP and stages 1 and 2 hypertension are provided in Sections 6 and 8, respectively.

Lifetime Risk of Hypertension\nObservational studies have documented a relatively high inci-\ndence of hypertension over periods of 5 to 10 years of follow-\nup.S3.2-1,S3.2-2 Thus, there is a much higher long-term population \nburden of hypertension as BP progressively increases with age. \nSeveral studies have estimated the long-term cumulative inci-dence of developing hypertension.\nS3.2-3,S3.2-4 In an analysis of \n1132 white male medical students (mean age: approximately 23 years at baseline) in the Johns Hopkins Precursors study, 0.3%, 6.5%, and 37% developed hypertension at age 25, 45, \nand 65 years, respectively.\nS3.2-5 In MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study \nof Atherosclerosis), the percentage of the population develop-\ning hypertension over their lifetimes was higher for African \nAmericans and Hispanics than for whites and Asians.S3.2-3 For \nadults 45 years of age without hypertension, the 40-year risk \nof developing hypertension was 93% for African-American, 92% for Hispanic, 86% for white, and 84% for Chinese \nadults.\nS3.2-3 In the Framingham Heart Study, approximately \n90% of adults free of hypertension at age 55 or 65 years devel-\noped hypertension during their lifetimes.S3.2-4 All of these esti-\nmates were based on use of the 140/90–mm Hg cutpoint for \nrecognition of hypertension and would have been higher had \nthe 130/80–mm Hg cutpoint been used.\n3.3. Prevalence of High BP\nPrevalence estimates are greatly influenced by the choice of cutpoints to categorize high BP, the methods used to estab-\nlish the diagnosis, and the population studied.\nS3.3-1,S3.3-2 Most \ngeneral population prevalence estimates are derived from \nnational surveys.

As a consequence, the new definition results in \nonly a small increase in the percentage of US adults for whom \nantihypertensive medication is recommended in conjunction with lifestyle modification.\nThe prevalence of hypertension rises dramatically with \nincreasing age and is higher in blacks than in whites, Asians, and Hispanic Americans. NHANES estimates of JNC 7–defined hypertension prevalence have remained fairly stable since the early 2000s.\nS3.3-1 Most contemporary population sur -\nveys, including NHANES, rely on an average of BP measure-ments obtained at a single visit,\nS3.3-2 which is likely to result in an overestimate of hypertension prevalence compared \nwith what would be found by using an average of ≥ 2 read-\nings taken on ≥ 2 visits,S3.3-1 as recommended in current and \nprevious BP guidelines.S3.3-3–S3.3-5 The extent to which guide-\nline recommendations for use of BP averages from ≥ 2 occa-\nsions is followed in practice is unclear. Adding self-report of previously diagnosed hypertension yields a 5% to 10% \nhigher estimate of prevalence.\nS3.3-1,S3.3-6,S3.3-7 Most individuals \nwho were added by use of this expanded definition have been diagnosed as having hypertension by a health professional \non >1 occasion, and many have been advised to change their lifestyle.\nS3.3-2,S3.3-6\n3.4. Awareness, Treatment, and Control\nPrevalence estimates for awareness, treatment, and con-trol of hypertension are usually based on self-reports of the \nhypertension diagnosis (awareness), use of BP-lowering \nmedications in those with hypertension (treatment), and achievement of a satisfactory SBP/DBP during treatment of hypertension (control). Before the present publication, awareness and treatment in adults were based on the SBP/DBP cutpoints of 140/90 mm Hg, and control was based on an SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg.

Measurement of BP\n4.1. Accurate Measurement of BP in the Office\nRecommendation for Accurate Measurement of BP in the Office\nCOR LOE Recommendation\nI C-EO1. For diagnosis and management of high \nBP, proper methods are recommended for accurate measurement and documentation of BP (Table 8).\nSynopsis\nAlthough measurement of BP in office settings is relatively \neasy, errors are common and can result in a misleading esti-\nmation of an individual’s true level of BP. There are various \nmethods for measuring BP in the office. The clinical standard \nof auscultatory measures calibrated to a column of mercury \nhas given way to oscillometric devices (in part because of \ntoxicological issues with mercury). Oscillometric devices \nuse a sensor that detects oscillations in pulsatile blood vol-\nume during cuff inflation and deflation. BP is indirectly cal-\nculated from maximum amplitude algorithms that involve \npopulation-based data. For this reason, only devices with a Table 8.  Checklist for Accurate Measurement of BPS4.1-3,S4.1-4\nKey Steps for Proper \nBP Measurements Specific Instructions\nStep 1: Properly prepare the patient1. Have the patient relax, sitting in a chair (feet on floor, back supported) for >5 min.\n2. The patient should avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least 30 min before measurement.\n3. Ensure patient has emptied his/her bladder.\n4. Neither the patient nor the observer should talk during the rest period or during the measurement.\n5. Remove all clothing covering the location of cuff placement.\n6. Measurements made while the patient is sitting or lying on an examining table do not fulfill these criteria.\nStep 2: Use proper technique for BP measurements1. Use a BP measurement device that has been validated, and ensure that the device is calibrated periodically.\n*\n2. Support the patient’s arm (eg, resting on a desk).\n3. Position the middle of the cuff on the patient’s upper arm at the level of the right atrium (the midpoint of the sternum).\n4. Use the correct cuff size, such that the bladder encircles 80% of the arm, and note if a larger- or smaller-than-normal cuff size is used (Table 9).\n5. Either the stethoscope diaphragm or bell may be used for auscultatory readings.\nS4.1-5,S4.1-6\nStep 3: Take the proper measurements needed for diagnosis and treatment of elevated BP/hypertension1. At the first visit, record BP in both arms. Use the arm that gives the higher reading for subsequent readings.\n2. Separate repeated measurements by  \n1–2 min.\n3. For auscultatory determinations, use a palpated estimate of radial pulse obliteration pressure to estimate SBP. Inflate the cuff 20–30 mm Hg above this level for an auscultatory determination of the BP level.\n4. For auscultatory readings, deflate the cuff pressure 2 mm Hg per second, and listen for Korotkoff sounds.\nStep 4: Properly document accurate BP readings1. Record SBP and DBP. If using the auscultatory technique, record SBP and DBP as onset of the first Korotkoff sound and disappearance of all Korotkoff sounds, respectively, using the nearest even number.\n2. Note the time of most recent BP medication taken before measurements.\nStep 5: Average the readingsUse an average of ≥2 readings obtained on ≥2 occasions to estimate the individual’s level of BP.\nStep 6: Provide BP readings to patientProvide patients the SBP/DBP readings both verbally and in writing.\n*See",

Many of the newer \noscillometric devices automatically inflate multiple times (in 1- to 2-minute intervals), allowing patients to be alone \nand undisturbed during measurement. Although much of the \navailable BP-related risk information and antihypertensive \ntreatment trial experience have been generated by using “tra-ditional” office methods of BP measurement, there is a grow-\ning evidence base supporting the use of automated office BP \nmeasurements.\nS4.1-1\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Accurate measurement and recording of BP are essen-\ntial to categorize level of BP, ascertain BP-related CVD risk, and guide management of high BP. Most systematic \nerrors in BP measurement can be avoided by following \nthe suggestions provided in Table 8, including having \nthe patient sit quietly for 5 minutes before a reading is \ntaken, supporting the limb used to measure BP, ensuring the BP cuff is at heart level, using the correct cuff size (Table 9), and, for auscultatory readings, deflating the cuff slowly.\nS4.1-2 In those who are already taking medica-\ntion that affects BP, the timing of BP measurements in relation to ingestion of the patient’s medication should \nbe standardized. Because individual BP measurements \ntend to vary in an unpredictable or random fashion, a single reading is inadequate for clinical decision-mak-ing. An average of 2 to 3 BP measurements obtained on 2 to 3 separate occasions will minimize random error and provide a more accurate basis for estimation of BP. In addition to clinicians, other caregivers and patients who perform BP self-monitoring should be trained to \nfollow the checklist in Table 8. Common errors in clini-\ncal practice that can lead to inaccurate estimation of BP include failure to allow for a rest period and/or talking with the patient during or immediately before the record-ing, improper patient positioning (eg, sitting or lying on an examination table), rapid cuff deflation (for ausculta-\ntory readings), and reliance on BPs measured at a single \noccasion.\n4.2. Out-of-Office and Self-Monitoring of BP\nRecommendation for Out-of-Office and Self-Monitoring of BP\nReferences that support the recommendation are \nsummarized in Online Data Supplement 3 and Systematic Review Report.\nCOR LOE Recommendation\nI ASR1. Out-of-office BP measurements are \nrecommended to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension (Table 11) and for titration of BP-lowering medication, in conjunction with telehealth counseling or clinical interventions.\nS4.2-1–S4.2-4\nSR indicates systematic review.\nSynopsis\nOut-of-office measurement of BP can be helpful for confir -\nmation and management of hypertension. Self-monitoring of BP refers to the regular measurement of BP by an indi-\nvidual at home or elsewhere outside the clinic setting. \nAmong individuals with hypertension, self-monitoring of \nBP, without other interventions, has shown limited evidence \nfor treatment-related BP reduction and achievement of BP \ncontrol.S4.2-1,S4.2-5,S4.2-6 However, with the increased recogni-\ntion of inconsistencies between office and out-of-office BPs (see",

Although ABPM is generally accepted as the best out-of-office measurement method, HBPM is often a more practical approach in clini-\ncal practice. Recommended procedures for the collection \nof HBPM data are provided in Table 10. If self-monitor -\ning is used, it is important to ensure that the BP measure-ment device used has been validated with an internationally \naccepted protocol and the results have been published in \na peer-reviewed journal.\nS4.2-7 A guide to the relationship \nbetween HBPM BP readings and corresponding read-\nings obtained in the office and by ABPM is presented in \nTable 11. The precise relationships between office readings, ABPM, and HBPM are unsettled, but there is general agree-ment that office BPs are often higher than ABPM or HBPM \nBPs, especially at higher BPs.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. ABPM is used to obtain out-of-office BP readings at \nset intervals, usually over a period of 24 hours. HBPM \nis used to obtain a record of out-of-office BP readings \ntaken by a patient. Both ABPM and HBPM typically \nprovide BP estimates that are based on multiple mea-\nsurements. A systematic review conducted by the US Preventive Services Task Force reported that ABPM \nprovided a better method to predict long-term CVD out-\ncomes than did office BPs. It incorporates new informa-\ntion from studies of HBPM, ABPM, the relationship of \noverall CVD risk to the effectiveness of blood pressure lowering, clinical outcomes related to different blood \npressure goals, strategies to improve blood pressure con-\ntrol and various other areas. A small body of evidence suggested, but did not confirm, that HBPM could serve \nas a similar predictor of outcomes.\nS4.2-4 Meta-analyses of \nRCTs have identified clinically useful reductions in SBP \nand DBP and achievement of BP goals at 6 months and 1 year when self-monitoring of BP has been used in con-\njunction with other interventions, compared with usual \ncare.

If differences are significant, instruct patient to measure BPs in the arm with higher readings.\nInstructions on HBPM procedures:\n Remain still:\n   Avoid smoking, caffeinated beverages, or exercise within 30 min before \nBP measurements.\n   Ensure ≥5 min of quiet rest before BP measurements.\n Sit correctly:\n   Sit with back straight and supported (on a straight-backed dining chair, for example, rather than a sofa).\n  Sit with feet flat on the floor and legs uncrossed.\n   Keep arm supported on a flat surface (such as a table), with the upper arm at heart level.\n   Bottom of the cuff should be placed directly above the antecubital fossa (bend of the elbow).\n Take multiple readings:\n   Take at least 2 readings 1 min apart in morning before taking medications and in evening before supper. Optimally, measure and record BP daily. Ideally, obtain weekly BP readings beginning 2 weeks after a change in the treatment regimen and during the week before a clinic visit.\n Record all readings accurately:\n   Monitors with built-in memory should be brought to all clinic appointments.\n   BP should be based on an average of readings on ≥2 occasions for clinical decision making.\nThe information above may be reinforced with videos available online.\nSee Table 11 for HBPM targets.BP indicates blood pressure; and HBPM, home blood pressure monitoring.\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\ne26  Hypertension  June 2018\nfor monitoring out-of-office BP levels, and even the BP thresh-\nolds used to define hypertension with ABPM or HBPM read-ings. In addition, there are few data that address reproducibility of these hypertension profiles over time, with several studies \nsuggesting progression of white coat hypertension and espe-\ncially of masked hypertension to sustained office-measured \nhypertension.\nS4.3-16–S4.3-22\n4.4. Masked and White Coat Hypertension\nRecommendations for Masked and White Coat Hypertension\nReferences that support recommendations are summarized \nin Online Data Supplements 4, 5, and 6.\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nIIa B-NR1. In adults with an untreated SBP greater than \n130 mm Hg but less than 160 mm Hg or DBP greater than 80 mm Hg but less than 100 mm Hg, it is reasonable to screen for the presence of white coat hypertension by using either daytime ABPM or HBPM before diagnosis of hypertension.\nS4.4-1–S4.4-8\nIIa C-LD2. In adults with white coat hypertension, periodic monitoring with either ABPM or HBPM is reasonable to detect transition to sustained hypertension (S4.4-2,S4.4-5,S4.4-7).\nIIa C-LD3. In adults being treated for hypertension with office BP readings not at goal and HBPM readings suggestive of a significant white coat effect, confirmation by ABPM can be useful (S4.4-9,S4.4-10).\nIIa B-NR4. In adults with untreated office BPs that are consistently between 120 mm Hg and 129 mm Hg for SBP or between 75 mm Hg and 79 mm Hg for DBP, screening for masked hypertension with HBPM (or ABPM) is reasonable (S4.4-3,S4.4-4,S4.4-6,S4.4-8,S4.4-11).\nIIb C-LD5. In adults on multiple-drug therapies for hypertension and office BPs within 10 mm Hg above goal, it may be reasonable to screen for white coat effect with HBPM (or ABPM) (S4.4-3,S4.4-7,S4.4-12).\nIIb C-EO6. It may be reasonable to screen for masked uncontrolled hypertension with HBPM in adults being treated for hypertension and office readings at goal, in the presence of target organ damage or increased overall CVD risk.\nIIb C-EO7. In adults being treated for hypertension with elevated HBPM readings suggestive of masked uncontrolled hypertension, confirmation of the diagnosis by ABPM might be reasonable before intensification of antihypertensive drug treatment.\nSynopsis\nThe availability of noninvasive BP monitoring techniques \nhas resulted in differentiation of hypertension into several clinically useful categories that are based on the place of BP measurement (Table 12).\nS4.4-1,S4.4-13,S4.4-14 These include masked \nhypertension and white coat hypertension, in addition to sus-\ntained hypertension. White coat hypertension is characterized \nby elevated office BP but normal readings when measured outside the office with either ABPM or HBPM. In contrast, masked hypertension is characterized by office readings sug-gesting normal BP but out-of-office (ABPM/HBPM) read-\nings that are consistently above normal.\nS4.4-15 In sustained \nhypertension, BP readings are elevated in both office and out-\nof-office settings.\nIn patients treated for hypertension, both “white coat \neffect” (higher office BPs than out-of-office BPs) and \n“masked uncontrolled hypertension” (controlled office BPs \nbut uncontrolled BPs in out-of-office settings) categories have been reported.\nS4.4-5,S4.4-15,S4.4-16 The white coat effect (usu-\nally considered clinically significant when office SBP/DBPs are >20/10 mm Hg higher than home or ABPM SBP/DBPs) \nhas been implicated in “pseudo-resistant hypertension” (see",

Figure 2 is an algorithm on detection of white coat \neffect or masked uncontrolled hypertension in patients on drug \ntherapy. Table 12 is a summary of BP patterns based on office \nand out-of-office measurements.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. White coat hypertension prevalence averages approxi-\nmately 13% and as high as 35% in some hypertensive \npopulations,S4.4-1,S4.4-2 and ABPM and HBPM are better \npredictors of CVD risk due to elevated BP than are of-fice BP measurements, with ABPM being the preferred measurement option. The major clinical relevance of \nwhite coat hypertension is that it has typically been as-\nsociated with a minimal to only slightly increased risk of \nCVD and all-cause mortality risk.\nS4.4-3,S4.4-4,S4.4-7,S4.4-11,S4.4-24 \nIf ABPM resources are not readily available, HBPM pro-\nvides a reasonable but less desirable alternative to screen \nfor white coat hypertension, although the overlap with \nABPM is only 60% to 70% for detection of white coat \nhypertension.S4.4-5,S4.4-9,S4.4-27–S4.4-30\n2. The incidence of white coat hypertension converting to sustained hypertension (justifying the addition of antihy-\npertensive drug therapy to lifestyle modification) is 1% to \n5% per year by ABPM or HBPM, with a higher incidence \nof conversion in those with elevated BP, older age, obe-\nsity, or black race.\nS4.4-2,S4.4-7\n3. The overlap between HBPM and both daytime and 24-hour ABPM in diagnosing white coat hyperten-\nsion is only 60% to 70%, and the data for prediction \nof CVD risk are stronger with ABPM than with office \nmeasurements.\nS4.4-5,S4.4-9,S4.4-27–S4.4-30 Because a diagnosis of \nwhite coat hypertension may result in a decision not to treat or intensify treatment in patients with elevated office \nBP readings, confirmation of BP control by ABPM in ad-\ndition to HBPM provides added support for this decision.\n4. In contrast to white coat hypertension, masked hyperten-sion is associated with a CVD and all-cause mortality risk twice as high as that seen in normotensive individuals, \nwith a risk range similar to that of patients with sustained hypertension.\nS4.4-3,S4.4-4,S4.4-6,S4.4-8,S4.4-11,S4.4-31 Therefore, out-\nof-office readings are reasonable to confirm BP control seen with office readings.\n5. The white coat effect has been implicated in office-measured uncontrolled hypertension and pseudo-  \nresistant hypertension, which may result in BP control being underestimated when subsequently assessed by ABPM.\nS4.4-17,S4.4-18 The risk of vascular complications  \nin patients with office-measured uncontrolled hyperten-sion with a white coat effect is similar to the risk in those \nwith controlled hypertension.\nS4.4-3,S4.4-4,S4.4-7,S4.4-11,S4.4-12 White \ncoat hypertension and white coat effect raise the concern that unnecessary antihypertensive drug therapy may be \ninitiated or intensified. Because a diagnosis of white coat hypertension or white coat effect would result in a deci-sion to not treat elevated office BP readings, confirmation \nof BP control by HBPM (or ABPM) provides more de-\nfinitive support for the decision not to initiate antihyper -\ntensive drug therapy or accelerate treatment.\n6. Analogous to masked hypertension in untreated patients, masked uncontrolled hypertension is defined in treated pa-tients with hypertension by office readings suggesting ad-equate BP control but out-of-office readings (HBPM) that remain consistently above goal.\nS4.4-3,S4.4-15,S4.4-16,S4.4-32,S4.4-33  \nThe CVD risk profile for masked uncontrolled hyper -\ntension appears to follow the risk profile for masked hypertension.\nS4.4-3,S4.4-12,S4.4-34 Although the evidence is \nconsistent in identifying the increased risk of masked uncontrolled hypertension, evidence is lacking on whether the treatment of masked hypertension or masked uncontrolled hypertension reduces clinical outcomes.

Causes of Hypertension\n5.1. Genetic Predisposition\nHypertension is a complex polygenic disorder in which many \ngenes or gene combinations influence BP.S5.1-1,S5.1-2 Although \nseveral monogenic forms of hypertension have been identified, \nsuch as glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, Liddle’s \nsyndrome, Gordon’s syndrome, and others in which single-gene mutations fully explain the pathophysiology of hyper -\ntension, these disorders are rare.\nS5.1-3 The current tabulation of \nknown genetic variants contributing to BP and hypertension includes more than 25 rare mutations and 120 single-nucleo-\ntide polymorphisms.\nS5.1-3,S5.1-4 However, even with the discov-\nery of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms influencing \ncontrol of BP since completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, the associated variants have only small effects. \nIndeed, at present, the collective effect of all BP loci identified \nthrough genome-wide association studies accounts for only about 3.5% of BP variability.\nS5.1-4 The presence of a high num-\nber of small-effect alleles associated with higher BP results in a more rapid increase in BP with age.\nS5.1-5 Future studies \nwill need to better elucidate genetic expression, epigenetic \neffects, transcriptomics, and proteomics that link genotypes \nwith underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.\n5.2. Environmental Risk Factors\nVarious environmental exposures, including components of diet, physical activity, and alcohol consumption, influence BP. Many dietary components have been associated with \nhigh BP.\nS5.2-1,S5.2-2 Some of the diet-related factors associated \nwith high BP include overweight and obesity, excess intake of sodium, and insufficient intake of potassium, calcium, magnesium, protein (especially from vegetables), fiber, and fish fats. Poor diet, physical inactivity, and excess intake of alcohol, alone or in combination, are the underlying cause of a large proportion of hypertension. Gut microbiota have \nalso been linked to hypertension, especially in experimental \nanimals.\nS5.2-3 Some of the best-proven environmental rela-\ntionships with high BP are briefly reviewed below, and non-pharmacological interventions to lower BP are discussed in",

In combined data from 4 longitudinal stud-ies begun in adolescence with repeat examination in young adulthood to early middle age, being obese continuously or acquiring obesity was associated with a relative risk of 2.7 for developing hypertension.

Physical FitnessEpidemiological studies have demonstrated an inverse relation-ship between physical activity and physical fitness and level \nof BP and hypertension.\nS5.2.4-40 Even modest levels of physical \nactivity have been associated with a decrease in the risk of inci-\ndent hypertension.S5.2.4-41 In several observational studies, the \nrelationship between physical activity and BP has been most apparent in white men.\nS5.2.4-40 With the advent of electronic \nactivity trackers and ABPM, it has become increasingly feasi-ble to conduct studies that relate physical activity and BP.\nS5.2.4-42  \nPhysical fitness, measured objectively by graded exercise testing, attenuates the rise of BP with age and prevents the development of hypertension. In the CARDIA (Coronary \nArtery Risk Development in Young Adults) study,\nS5.2.4-43 phys-\nical fitness measured at 18 to 30 years of age in the upper \n2 deciles of an otherwise healthy population was associated \nwith one third the risk of developing hypertension 15 years later, and one half the risk after adjustment for body mass \nindex, as compared with the lowest quintile. Change in fitness \nassessed 7 years later further modified risk.\nS5.2.4-43 In a cohort \nof men 20 to 90 years of age who were followed longitudi-\nnally for 3 to 28 years, higher physical fitness decreased the \nrate of rise in SBP over time and delayed the time to onset of hypertension.\nS5.2.4-44\n5.2.5. AlcoholThe presence of a direct relationship between alcohol \nconsumption and BP was first reported in 1915\nS5.2.5-45 and \nhas been repeatedly identified in contemporary cross-sec-tional and prospective cohort studies.\nS5.2.5-46 Estimates of the \ncontribution of alcohol consumption to population incidence \nand prevalence of hypertension vary according to level of \nintake.

    "content": ", before initiation of treatment.\nSecondary hypertension can underlie severe elevation \nof BP, pharmacologically resistant hypertension, sud-den onset of hypertension, increased BP in patients with hypertension previously controlled on drug therapy, onset of diastolic hypertension in older adults, and target organ damage disproportionate to the duration or severity of the hypertension. Although secondary hypertension should be suspected in younger patients (<30 years of age) with elevated BP, it is not uncommon for primary hypertension to manifest at a younger age, especially in blacks,\nS5.4-2 and \nsome forms of secondary hypertension, such as renovas-cular disease, are more common at older age. Many of the causes of secondary hypertension are strongly associated with clinical findings or groups of findings that suggest a specific disorder.\nFigure 3 is an algorithm on screening for secondary \nhypertension. Table 13 is a detailed list of clinical indica-tions and diagnostic screening tests for secondary hyperten-sion, and Table 14 is a list of drugs that can induce secondary \nhypertension.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. The causes of secondary hypertension and recommend-\ned screening tests are provided in Table 13, and drugs that can induce secondary hypertension are provided in \nTable 14.\n2. Diagnosis of many of these disorders requires a complex \nset of measurements, specialized technical expertise, and/or experience in data interpretation. Similarly, specific treatment often requires a level of technical training and \nexperience.\n5.4.1. Drugs and Other Substances With Potential  \nto Impair BP Control\nNumerous substances, including prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, herbals, and food substances, may affect BP (Table 14).\nS5.4.1-1–S5.4.1-6 Changes in BP that \noccur because of drugs and other agents have been associ-ated with the development of hypertension, worsening con-trol in a patient who already has hypertension, or attenuation of the BP-lowering effects of antihypertensive therapy. A \nchange in BP may also result from drug–drug or drug–food \ninteractions.\nS5.4.1-2,S5.4.1-4 In the clinical assessment of hyper -\ntension, a careful history should be taken with regard to sub-stances that may impair BP control, with close attention paid to not only prescription medications, but also over-the-counter substances, illicit drugs, and herbal products. When feasible, drugs associated with increased BP should be reduced or dis-continued, and alternative agents should be used.\n5.4.2. Primary Aldosteronism\nRecommendations for Primary Aldosteronism\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nI C-EO1. In adults with hypertension, screening for \nprimary aldosteronism is recommended in the presence of any of the following concurrent conditions: resistant hypertension, hypokalemia (spontaneous or substantial, if diuretic induced), incidentally discovered adrenal mass, family history of early-onset hypertension, or stroke at a young age (<40 years).\nI C-LD2. Use of the plasma aldosterone: renin activity ratio is recommended when adults are screened for primary aldosteronism.\nS5.4.2-1\nI C-EO3. In adults with hypertension and a positive screening test for primary aldosteronism, referral to a hypertension specialist or endocrinologist is recommended for further evaluation and treatment.\nSynopsis\nPrimary aldosteronism is defined as a group of disorders in \nwhich aldosterone production is inappropriately high for sodium status, is relatively autonomous of the major regula-tors of secretion (angiotensin II and potassium), and cannot be suppressed with sodium loading.\nS5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3 The increased \nproduction of aldosterone induces hypertension; cardiovascu-lar and kidney damage; sodium retention; suppressed plasma renin activity; and increased potassium excretion, which, if prolonged and severe, may cause hypokalemia. However, hypokalemia is absent in the majority of cases and has a low negative predictive value for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism.\nS5.4.2-4 In about 50% of the patients, primary \naldosteronism is due to increased unilateral aldosterone pro-duction (usually aldosterone-producing adenoma or, rarely, unilateral adrenal hyperplasia); in the remaining 50%, pri-mary aldosteronism is due to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia \n(idiopathic hyperaldosteronism).\nS5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nWhelton et al  2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline  e33\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Primary aldosteronism is one of the most frequent dis-\norders (occurring in 5% to 10% of patients with hyper -\ntension and 20% of patients with resistant hyperten-sion) that causes secondary hypertension.\nS5.4.2-5,S5.4.2-6 \nThe toxic tissue effects of aldosterone induce greater \ntarget organ damage in primary aldosteronism than \nin primary hypertension. Patients with primary aldo-steronism have a 3.7-fold increase in HF, a 4.2-fold \nincrease in stroke, a 6.5-fold increase in MI, a 12.1-\nfold increase in atrial fibrillation (AF), increased left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunc-tion, increased stiffness of large arteries, widespread \ntissue fibrosis, increased remodeling of resistance \nvessels, and increased kidney damage as compared \nwith patients with primary hypertension matched for BP level.\nS5.4.2-6–S5.4.2-8 Because the deleterious effects of aldosterone overproduction are often reversible with \nunilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy or treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (ie, spi-\nronolactone or eplerenone), screening of patients with \nhypertension at increased risk of primary aldosteron-ism is beneficial.\nS5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3 These include hypertensive \npatients with adrenal “incidentaloma,” an incidentally discovered adrenal lesion on a computed tomography \nor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed \nfor other purposes. Patients with hypertension and a history of early onset hypertension and/or cerebro-vascular accident at a young age may have primary \naldosteronism due to glucocorticoid-remediable al-\ndosteronism (familial hyperaldosteronism type-1) and therefore warrant screening.\nS5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3\n2. The aldosterone:renin activity ratio is currently the most \naccurate and reliable means of screening for primary Table 14.

The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism generally re-quires a confirmatory test (intravenous saline suppression \ntest or oral salt-loading test).\nS5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3 If the diagnosis \nof primary aldosteronism is confirmed (and the patient agrees that surgery would be desirable), the patient is re-\nferred for an adrenal venous sampling procedure to de-termine whether the increased aldosterone production is unilateral or bilateral in origin. If unilateral aldosterone production is documented on adrenal venous sampling, \nthe patient is referred for unilateral laparoscopic adrenal-\nectomy, which improves BP in virtually 100% of patients \nand results in a complete cure of hypertension in about \n50%.\nS5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3 If the patient has bilaterally increased \naldosterone secretion on adrenal venous sampling or \nhas a unilateral source of excess aldosterone production \nbut cannot undergo surgery, the patient is treated with spi-ronolactone or eplerenone as agent of choice.\nS5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3 \nBoth adrenalectomy and medical ktherapy are effective \nin lowering BP and reversing LVH.

Renal Artery Stenosis\nRecommendations for Renal Artery Stenosis\nReferences that support recommendations are summarized \nin Online Data Supplements 7 and 24.\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nI A1. Medical therapy is recommended for  \nadults with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.\nS5.4.3-1,S5.4.3-2\nIIb C-EO2. In adults with renal artery stenosis for whom medical management has failed (refractory hypertension, worsening renal function, and/or intractable HF) and those with nonatherosclerotic disease, including fibromuscular dysplasia, it may be reasonable to refer the patient for consideration of revascularization (percutaneous renal artery angioplasty and/or stent placement).\nSynopsis\nRenal artery stenosis refers to a narrowing of the renal artery \nthat can result in a restriction of blood flow. Atherosclerotic disease (90%) is by far the most common cause of renal artery stenosis, whereas nonatherosclerotic disease (of which fibro-\nmuscular dysplasia is the most common) is much less prevalent and tends to occur in younger, healthier patients.\nS5.4.3-3 Renal \nartery stenosis is a common form of secondary hypertension. Relieving ischemia and the ensuing postischemic release of \nrenin by surgical renal artery reconstruction is an invasive strat-\negy with a postoperative mortality as high as 13%.\nS5.4.3-4 With \nthe advent of endovascular procedures to restore blood flow, several trials were designed to test the efficacy of these pro-cedures against medical therapy, but they suggested no benefit over medical therapy alone.\nS5.4.3-1,S5.4.3-2\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Atherosclerotic disease in the renal arteries represents \nsystemic disease and higher risk of both renal failure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. No RCT to date has demonstrated a clinical advantage of renal artery revascularization (with either angioplasty or stenting) \nover medical therapy.\nS5.4.3-2 On the basis of the CORAL \n(Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic \nLesions) trial, the recommended medical approach en-compasses optimal management of hypertension with an antihypertensive regimen that includes a renin-angio-tensin system (RAS) blocker, in addition to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with a high-intensity statin, smoking cessation, hemoglobin A1c reduction in patients with DM, and antiplatelet therapy.\nS5.4.3-1\n2. Revascularization may be considered for those who do not respond to medical therapy and for those who have nonatherosclerotic disease (eg, Takayasu arteritis in Asian populations, fibromuscular dysplasia in other populations). Fibromuscular dysplasia occurs over the lifespan of women (mean: 53 years of age) with almost equal frequency in the renal and carotid circulations.\nS5.4.3-3 \nPercutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone (without stenting) can improve BP control and even normalize BP, especially in patients with recent onset of hypertension or resistant hypertension.\nS5.4.3-5\n5.4.4. Obstructive Sleep Apnea\nRecommendation for Obstructive Sleep Apnea\nReferences that support the recommendation are \nsummarized in Online Data Supplement 8.\nCOR LOE Recommendation\nIIb B-R1. In adults with hypertension and obstructive \nsleep apnea, the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to reduce BP is not well established.\nS5.4.4-1–S5.4.4-5\nSynopsis\nObstructive sleep apnea is a common chronic condition char -\nacterized by recurrent collapse of upper airways during sleep, \ninducing intermittent episodes of apnea/hypopnea, hypox-\nemia, and sleep disruption.S5.4.4-6 Obstructive sleep apnea is a \nrisk factor for several CVDs, including hypertension, coro-\nnary and cerebrovascular diseases, HF, and AF.S5.4.4-6–S5.4.4-9  \nObservational studies have shown that the presence of obstruc-tive sleep apnea is associated with increased risk of inci-dent hypertension.\nS5.4.4-10,S5.4.4-11 Obstructive sleep apnea is  \nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nWhelton et al  2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline  e35\nhighly prevalent in adults with resistant hypertension  \n(≥80%),S5.4.4-12,S5.4.4-13 and it has been hypothesized that treat-\nment with CPAP may have more pronounced effects on BP \nreduction in resistant hypertension.S5.4.4-6\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. CPAP is an efficacious treatment for improving obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea. However, studies of the effects of CPAP on BP have demonstrated only small effects on BP (eg, 2– to 3–mm Hg reductions), with results dependent on \npatient compliance with CPAP use, severity of obstruc-\ntive sleep apnea, and presence of daytime sleepiness in study participants.\nS5.4.4-1–S5.4.4-5 Although many RCTs have \nbeen reported that address the effects of CPAP on BP in obstructive sleep apnea, most of the patients studied did \nnot have documented hypertension, and the studies were \ntoo small and the follow-up period too short to allow for adequate evaluation. In addition, a well-designed RCT \ndemonstrated that CPAP plus usual care, compared with \nusual care alone, did not prevent cardiovascular events in patients with moderate–severe obstructive sleep apnea and established CVD.\nS5.4.4-14\n6. Nonpharmacological Interventions\nCorrecting the dietary aberrations, physical inactivity, and \nexcessive consumption of alcohol that cause high BP is a fundamentally important approach to prevention and man-agement of high BP, either on their own or in combination with pharmacological therapy. Prevention of hypertension and treatment of established hypertension are complemen-tary approaches to reducing CVD risk in the population, but prevention of hypertension provides the optimal means \nof reducing risk and avoiding the harmful consequences of hypertension.\nS6-1–S6-3 Nonpharmacological therapy alone is \nespecially useful for prevention of hypertension, including in adults with elevated BP, and for management of high BP in adults with milder forms of hypertension.\nS6-4,S6-5\n6.1. Strategies\nNonpharmacological interventions can be accomplished by means of behavioral strategies aimed at lifestyle change, prescription of dietary supplements, or implementation of kitchen-based interventions that directly modify elements of the diet. At a societal level, policy changes can enhance \nthe availability of healthy foods and facilitate physical activ-\nity. The goal can be to modestly reduce BP in the general \npopulation or to undertake more intensive targeted lowering \nof BP in adults with hypertension or at high risk of devel-\noping hypertension.\nS6.1-1 The intent of the general population \napproach is to achieve a small downward shift in the general \npopulation distribution of BP, which would be expected to result in substantial health benefits.\nS6.1-2 The targeted approach \nfocuses on BP reduction in adults at greatest risk of develop-ing BP-related CVD, including individuals with hypertension, as well as those at increased risk of developing hypertension, especially blacks and adults who are overweight, consume excessive amounts of dietary sodium, have a high intake of alcohol, or are physically inactive. The targeted approach tends to be intensive, with a more ambitious goal for BP reduction. Both approaches are complementary and mutually \nreinforcing, and modeling studies suggest they are likely to \nprovide similar public health benefit.\nS6.1-3,S6.1-4 However, as \nthe precision of risk prediction tools increases, targeted pre-\nvention strategies that focus on high-risk individuals seem to become more efficient than population-based strategies.\nS6.1-5\n6.2.

To a lesser extent, the Mediterranean \ndiet\nS6.2-49,S6.2-63 (which incorporates the basics of healthy eat-\ning but emphasizes consumption of legumes and monoun-\nsaturated fat, avoidance of red meats, and moderate intake of \nwine) has been effective in reducing BP, as well as improving \nlipid profile.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Weight loss is a core recommendation and should be \nachieved through a combination of reduced calorie intake and increased physical activity.\nS6.2-1 The BP-lowering effect of weight loss in patients with elevated BP is con-\nsistent with the corresponding effect in patients with \nestablished hypertension, with an apparent dose–re-\nsponse relationship of about 1 mm Hg per kilogram of \nweight loss. Achievement and maintenance of weight \nloss through behavior change are challengingS6.2-64–S6.2-66 \nbut feasible over prolonged periods of follow-up.S6.2-64 \nFor those who do not meet their weight loss goals with \nnonpharmacological interventions, pharmacotherapy or \nminimally invasive and bariatric surgical procedures can \nbe considered.S6.2-67,S6.2-68 Surgical procedures tend to be \nmore effective but are usually reserved for those with more severe and intractable obesity because of the fre-\nquency of complications.\nS6.2-69\n2. The DASH eating plan is the diet best demonstrated to be effective for lowering BP. Because the DASH diet is high \nin fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, it pro-\nvides a means to enhance intake of potassium, calcium, \nmagnesium, and fiber. In hypertensive and nonhyperten-sive adults, the DASH diet has produced overall reduc-\ntions in SBP of approximately 11 mm Hg and 3 mm Hg, \nrespectively,\nS6.2-7 and the diet was especially effective \nin blacks.S6.2-70 When combined with weight lossS6.2-6 or \na reduction in sodium intake,S6.2-5,S6.2-30 the effect size \nwas substantially increased.

Reduced dietary \nsodium has been reported to augment the BP-lowering \neffects of RAS blocker therapy.S6.2-79 Maintenance of \nthe lifestyle changes necessary to reduce sodium in-take is challenging,\nS6.2-2–S6.2-4,S6.2-12 but even a small \ndecrement in sodium consumption is likely to be  \nsafeS6.2-2,S6.2-4,S6.2-9,S6.2-12,S6.2-80 and beneficial,S6.2-8,S6.2-81 es-\npecially in those whose BP is salt sensitive.S6.2-82 In the \nUnited States, most dietary sodium comes from addi-tions during food processing or during commercial food preparation at sit-down and fast-food restaurants.\nS6.2-83,S6.2-84 \nPerson-specific and policy approaches can be used to reduce dietary sodium intake.\nS6.2-85,S6.2-86 Individuals can \ntake action to reduce their dietary intake of sodium by choice of fresh foods, use of food labels to choose foods that are lower in sodium content, choice of foods with a “no added sodium” label, judicious use of condiments \nand sodium-infused foods, use of spices and low-sodium \nflavorings, careful ordering when eating out, control of food portion size, and avoiding or minimizing use of salt at the table. Dietary counseling by a nutrition-ist with expertise in behavior modification can be help-ful. A reduction in the amount of sodium added during food processing, as well as fast food and restaurant food preparation, has the potential to substantially reduce so-dium intake without the need for a conscious change in \nlifestyle.\nS6.2-81,S6.2-85,S6.2-874. Dietary potassium is inversely related to BP and hy-\npertension in migrant studies,S6.2-88 cross-sectional \nreports,S6.2-89–S6.2-91 and prospective cohort studies.S6.2-92 \nLikewise, dietary potassiumS6.2-93–S6.2-96 and a high in-\ntake of fruits and vegetables are associated with a lower incidence of stroke.\nS6.2-97 Potassium interventions \nhave been effective in lowering BP,S6.2-13,S6.2-14,S6.2-16,S6.2-81 \nespecially in adult patients consuming an excess of  \nsodiumS6.2-13,S6.2-74,S6.2-98 and in blacks.S6.2-13 The typical \nBP-lowering effect of a 60-mmol (1380-mg) adminis-tration of potassium chloride has been about 2 mm Hg and 4 to 5 mm Hg in adults with normotension and \nhypertension, respectively, although the response is up \nto twice as much in persons consuming a high-sodium \ndiet. A reduction in the sodium/potassium index may be more important than the corresponding changes in either electrolyte alone.\nS6.2-99 Some but not all studies \nsuggest that the intervention effect may be restricted to adult patients with a low (1500-mg to 2000-mg) daily intake of potassium.\nS6.2-92,S6.2-100 Most of the intervention \nexperience comes from trials of relatively short duration (median of 5 to 6 weeks),\nS6.2-13,S6.2-14 but the BP-lowering \neffect of potassium in adult patients consuming a high-sodium diet has been reproduced after an interval of 4.4 years.\nS6.2-98 In most trials, potassium supplementation \nwas achieved by administration of potassium chloride pills, but the BP response pattern was similar when di-etary modification was used.\nS6.2-13 Because potassium-\nrich diets tend to be heart healthy, they are preferred over use of pills for potassium supplementation. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans\nS6.2-101 encourage \na diet rich in potassium and identify the adequate intake level for adult patients as 4700 mg/day.\nS6.2-102 The World \nHealth Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 90 mmol (3510 mg) per day from food for adult patients.\nS6.2-15 Good sources of dietary potassium include \nfruits and vegetables, as well as low-fat dairy products, selected fish and meats, nuts, and soy products. Four to five servings of fruits and vegetables will usually provide 1500 to >3000 mg of potassium. This can be achieved by \na diet, such as the DASH diet, that is high in potassium \ncontent.\nS6.2-7\n5. A BP-lowering effect of increased physical activity has been repeatedly demonstrated in clinical trials, espe-cially during dynamic aerobic exercise,\nS6.2-18,S6.2-20,S6.2-22 \nbut also during dynamic resistance trainingS6.2-18,S6.2-21 \nand static isometric exercise.S6.2-18,S6.2-19,S6.2-31 The average \nreductions in SBP with aerobic exercise are approxi-mately 2 to 4 mm Hg and 5 to 8 mm Hg in adult patients with normotension and hypertension, respectively.\nS6.2-18 \nMost trials have been of relatively short duration, but increased physical activity has been an intrinsic compo-nent of longer-term weight reduction interventions used to reduce BP and prevent hypertension.\nS6.2-3,S6.2-4,S6.2-12 \nBP-lowering effects have been reported with lower- and higher-intensity exercise and with continuous and in-terval exercise training.\nS6.2-18,S6.2-103 Meta-analyses sug-\ngest isometric exercise results in substantial lowering of BP.\nS6.2-18,S6.2-19,S6.2-31\n6.

On bal-\nance, it seems reasonable for those who are consuming moderate quantities of alcohol (≤ 2 drinks/day) to con-\ntinue their moderate consumption of alcohol.\n7. Patient Evaluation\nThe patient evaluation is designed to identify target organ \ndamage and possible secondary causes of hypertension and to assist in planning an effective treatment regimen. Historical \nfeatures are relevant to the evaluation of the patient (Table 16). \nThe pattern of BP measurements and changes over time may differentiate primary from secondary causes of hypertension. A rise in BP associated with weight gain, lifestyle factors (such as a job change requiring travel and meals away from \nhome), reduced frequency or intensity of physical activity, \nor advancing age in a patient with a strong family history of hypertension would suggest the diagnosis of primary hyper -\ntension.

Automated oscillometric devices provide an opportunity to obtain repeated measurements without a pro-vider present, thereby minimizing the potential for a white coat effect. Change in BP from seated to standing position should \nbe measured to detect orthostatic hypotension (a decline >20 \nmm Hg in SBP or >10 mm Hg in DBP after 1 minute is abnor -\nmal). For adults ≤ 30 years of age with elevated brachial BP, a \nthigh BP measurement is indicated; if the thigh measurement is lower than arm pressures, a diagnosis of coarctation of the \naorta should be considered. The physical examination should include assessment of hypertension-related target organ dam-\nage. Attention should be paid to physical features that suggest secondary hypertension (Table 13).\n7.1. Laboratory Tests and Other Diagnostic \nProcedures\nLaboratory measurements should be obtained for all patients \nwith a new diagnosis of hypertension to facilitate CVD risk factor profiling, establish a baseline for medication use, and \nscreen for secondary causes of hypertension (Table 17). \nOptional tests may provide information on target organ damage.

LVH is com-monly measured by electrocardiography, echocardiography, or MRI.\nS7.2-5,S7.2-6 Left ventricular (LV) mass is associated \nwith body size (particularly lean body mass), tobacco use, \nheart rate (inverse), and long-standing DM.S7.2-7–S7.2-9 BP low-\nering leads to a reduction in LV mass. In TOMHS (Treatment \nof Mild Hypertension Study), the long-acting diuretic chlorthalidone was slightly more effective in reducing LVH \nthan were a calcium channel blocker (CCB) (amlodipine), \nACE inhibitor (enalapril), alpha-receptor blocker (doxazo-sin), or beta-receptor blocker (acebutolol).\nS7.2-10 Beta block-\ners are inferior to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and CCBs \nin reducing LVH.\nS7.2-11\nHypertension adversely impacts other echocardiographic \nmarkers of cardiac structure and function, including left atrial \nsize (both diameter and area; left atrial size is also a precursor of AF); diastolic function (many parameters; a precursor of \nHF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]); cardiac struc-\nture; and subclinical markers of LV systolic function, such as myocardial strain assessment with echocardiography and MRI.\nAssessment of LVH by means of echocardiography or \nMRI is not universally recommended during evaluation and management of hypertension in adults because there are limited data on the cost and value of these measures for CVD risk reclassification and changes in type or intensity of treatment. Assessment of LVH is most useful in adults who are young (≤ 18 years of age) or have evidence of sec-\nondary hypertension, chronic uncontrolled hypertension, or \nhistory of symptoms of HF. Electrocardiographic criteria \nfor LVH correlate weakly with echocardiographic or MRI \ndefinitions of LVH and are less strongly related to CVD  \noutcomes.\nS7.2-12–S7.2-15 Imprecision in lead placement accounts, \nin part, for the poor correlation of electrocardiographic mea-surements with direct imaging results. However, electrocar -\ndiographic LVH has been valuable in predicting CVD risk \nin some reports.\nS7.2-16,S7.2-17 Electrocardiography may also be \nuseful in the assessment of comorbidities, such as rhythm \ndisturbances and prior MI.\nLVH, as assessed by electrocardiography, echocar -\ndiography, or MRI, is an independent predictor of CVD \ncomplications.S7.2-18,S7.2-19 Reduction in LVH can predict a \nreduction in CVD risk, independent of change in BP.S7.2-20 \nWhen used in CVD risk predictor models, echocardiographic \nLVH has a small but significant independent effect on CVD risk in younger patients. At older ages, LVH measured by electrocardiography or MRI provides no independent con-tribution to prediction of CVD risk.\nS7.2-21–S7.2-23 Patients can \nbe classified into 4 groups on the basis of the presence or absence of LVH and a determination of whether the LVH has an eccentric (normal relative wall thickness) or concentric geometry.\nS7.2-6,S7.2-22\n8.

The relative risk reduction \nfor CVD prevention with use of BP-lowering medications is fairly constant for groups that differ in CVD risk across a wide range of estimated absolute risk\nS8.1.1-9,S8.1.1-10 and across \ngroups defined by sex, age, body mass index, and the pres-\nence or absence of DM, AF, and CKD.S8.1.1-5,S8.1.1-11–S8.1.1-21 As \na consequence, the absolute CVD risk reduction attributable to BP lowering is greater at greater absolute levels of CVD \nrisk.\nS8.1.1-9,S8.1.1-10,S8.1.1-12,S8.1.1-15–S8.1.1-19,S8.1.1-22,S8.1.1-23 Put another \nway, for a given magnitude of BP reduction due to antihy-pertensive medications, fewer individuals at high CVD risk would need to be treated to prevent a CVD event (ie, lower number needed to treat) than those at low CVD risk.Table 17.

Use of BP-lowering medications is \nrecommended for secondary prevention of recurrent CVD events in patients with clinical CVD and an average SBP of 130 mm Hg or higher or an average DBP of 80 mm Hg or higher, and for primary prevention in adults with an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 10% or higher and an average SBP 130 mm Hg or higher or an average DBP 80 mm Hg or higher.\nS8.1.2-1–S8.1.2-9DBP: C-EO\nI C-LD2. Use of BP-lowering medication is recommended for primary prevention  \nof CVD in adults with no history of  \nCVD and with an estimated 10-year  \nASCVD risk <10% and an SBP of  \n140 mm Hg or higher or a DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher.\nS8.1.2-3,S8.1.2-10–S8.1.2-13\n*ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations (http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-\nEstimator/)S8.1.2-13a to estimate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD. ASCVD was \ndefined as a first CHD death, non-fatal MI or fatal or non-fatal stroke.\nSynopsis\nWhereas treatment of high BP with BP-lowering medi-\ncations on the basis of BP level alone is considered cost effective,\nS8.1.2-14 use of a combination of absolute CVD risk \nand BP level to guide such treatment is more efficient and cost effective at reducing risk of CVD than is use of BP level  \nalone.\nS8.1.2-15–S8.1.2-24 Practical approaches have been developed \nto translate evidence from RCTs into individual patient treat-ment recommendations that are based on absolute net ben-efit for CVD risk,\nS8.1.2-25 and several national and international \nguidelines recommend basing use of BP-lowering medica-tions on a combination of absolute risk of CVD and level of BP instead of relying solely on level of BP.\nS8.1.2-26–S8.1.2-31\nAttempts to use absolute risk to guide implementation \nof pharmacological treatment to prevent CVD have had mixed results, with many reports of improvements in pro-vider prescribing behaviors, patient adherence, and reduc-tions in risk,\nS8.1.2-32–S8.1.2-38 but with others showing no impact on \nprovider behaviors.S8.1.2-39,S8.1.2-40 Use of global CVD risk assess-\nment is infrequent in routine clinical practice,S8.1.2-41–S8.1.2-46 which \nsuggests that intensive efforts would be required to achieve  \nuniversal implementation. The choice of specific risk calculators \nfor estimation of risk and risk threshold has been an important \nsource of variability, ambiguity, and controversy.S8.1.2-47–S8.1.2-54 \nIn addition, implementation of a standard (worldwide) abso-\nlute CVD risk threshold for initiating use of BP-lowering \nmedications would result in large variations in medication \nuse at a given level of BP across countries.S8.1.2-48,S8.1.2-54,S8.1.2-55  \nFuture research in this area should focus on issues related to \nimplementation of a risk-based approach to CVD prevention, including the use of BP-lowering medications. Although \nseveral CVD risk assessment tools are available, on the basis of current knowledge, we recommend use of the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations (http://tools.acc.org/\nASCVD-Risk-Estimator/) to estimate 10-year risk of athero-\nsclerotic CVD (ASCVD) to establish the BP threshold for  \ntreatment.\nS8.1.2-56,S8.1.2-57 It should be kept in mind that the \nACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations are validated for US \nadults ages 40 to 79 years in the absence of concurrent statin \ntherapy.S8.1.2-56 For those >79 years old, the 10-year ASCVD \nrisk is generally >10%, and thus the SBP threshold for anti-\nhypertensive drug treatment for patients >79 years old is 130 \nmm Hg. Two recent reviews have highlighted the importance \nof using predicted CVD risk together with BP to guide antihy-\npertensive drug therapy.S8.1.2-22,S8.1.2-23\nFigure 4 is an algorithm on BP thresholds and recommen-\ndations for treatment and follow-up.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. For the purposes of secondary prevention, clinical CVD is  \ndefined as CHD, congestive HF, and stroke. Several meta-  \nanalyses of RCTs support the value of using BP-lowering \nmedications, in addition to nonpharmacological treat-\nment, in patients with established CVD in the absence \nof hypertension, defined previously by an SBP ≥ 140 \nmm Hg or a DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg.S8.1.2-1,S8.1.2-6,S8.1.2-7,S8.1.2-9 \nMany RCTs of BP lowering in adults without CVD have \nused inclusion criteria designed to increase the level of \nCVD risk in the study populations to increase trial ef-\nficiency by facilitating shorter duration and a smaller sample size. As a consequence, few relatively low-risk \nadults with hypertension have been included in the trials. \nTrial results provide evidence of CVD prevention from \nuse of BP-lowering medications in adults with an aver -\nage SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg or an average DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg \nand clinical CVD; 5-year risk of CVD (defined as stroke, \nCHD, HF, or other CVD death) of approximately 6% to 7%;\nS8.1.2-3,S8.1.2-5 an estimated 10-year CVD death rate \nof approximately 4.5%;S8.1.2-4 or an annual rate of major \nCVD events of approximately 0.9% per year.S8.1.2-7 In the \nabsence of clinical CVD, these risk estimates are roughly \nequivalent to a 10-year risk of ASCVD exceeding 10% \nas per the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations.S8.1.2-56 \nSPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) \nprovides additional support for the use of BP-lowering \nmedications in patients without CVD at SBP levels ≥ 130 \nmm Hg; however, it is important to note that few SPRINT participants had untreated SBP between 130 mm Hg and \n139 mm Hg at baseline. Furthermore, SPRINT used \na Framingham 10-year risk of general CVD exceeding 15% to identify increased CVD risk.\nS8.1.2-8 Although this \nlevel of risk is lower than the levels described previously, being roughly equivalent to a 6% to 7% 10-year ASCVD risk per the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations, most \nof the participants in SPRINT had a much higher level \nof CVD risk. This recommendation differs from JNC 7 \nin its use of CVD risk, rather than diabetes or CKD, to \nrecognize patients, including older adults, with a SBP/\nDBP <140/90 mm Hg who are likely to benefit from \nBP lowering drug therapy in addition to nonpharma-\ncological antihypertensive treatment. In JNC 7, the BP \nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nWhelton et al  2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline  e41\nthreshold for initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy \nwas ≥ 140/90 mm Hg for the general adult population \nand ≥ 130/80 mm Hg for adults with diabetes or CKD. \nSince the publication of JNC 7 in 2003, we have gained additional experience with risk assessment and new data \nfrom randomized trials, observational studies and simu-\nlation analyses have demonstrated that antihypertensive \ndrug treatment based on overall ASCVD risk assessment combined with BP levels may prevent more CVD events \nthan treatment based on BP levels alone.\nS8.1.2-15–S8.1.2-24 \nAccording to an analysis of NHANES 2011-2014, the new definition results in only a small increase in the per -\ncentage of US adults for whom antihypertensive medica-tion is recommended in conjunction with lifestyle modifi-\ncation. The previously cited meta-analyses are consistent \nwith the conclusion that lowering of BP results in benefit \nin higher-risk individuals, regardless of their baseline \ntreated or untreated BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg and irrespective \nof the specific cause of their elevated risk. These analy-ses indicate that the benefit of treatment outweighs the \npotential harm at threshold BP ≥130/80 mm Hg.2. This recommendation is consistent with prior guidelines, such as JNC 7. In addition, for those for whom nonphar -\nmacological therapy has been ineffective, antihyperten-\nsive drug treatment should be added in patients with an SBP ≥140 mm Hg or a DBP ≥90 mm Hg, even in adults \nwho are at lower risk than those included in RCTs. The rationale for drug treatment in patients with an SBP ≥ 140 \nmm Hg or a DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an estimated 10-year \nrisk of CVD <10% is based on several lines of evidence. \nFirst, the relationship of SBP with risk of CVD is known \nto be continuous across levels of SBP and similar across \ngroups that differ in level of absolute risk.\nS8.1.2-10 Second, \nthe relative risk reduction attributable to BP-lowering \nmedication therapy is consistent across the range of ab-\nsolute risk observed in trials,S8.1.2-3,S8.1.2-11,S8.1.2-58 supporting \nthe contention that the relative risk reduction may be simi-\nlar at lower levels of absolute risk. This is the case even \nin a meta-analysis of trials in adults without clinical CVD and an average SBP/DBP of 146/84 mm Hg.\nS8.1.2-5 Finally, \nmodeling studies support the effectiveness and cost-  \neffectiveness of treatment of younger, lower-risk patients Figure 4. Blood pressure (BP) thresholds and recommendations for treatment and follow-up. Colors correspond to Class of \nRecommendation in Table 1. *Using the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations.S8.1.2-56,S8.1.2-57 Note that patients with DM or CKD are \nautomatically placed in the high-risk category. For initiation of RAS inhibitor or diuretic therapy, assess blood tests for electrolytes \nand renal function 2 to 4 weeks after initiating therapy. †Consider initiation of pharmacological therapy for stage 2 hypertension with 2 antihypertensive agents of different classes. Patients with stage 2 hypertension and BP ≥160/100 mm Hg should be promptly treated, carefully monitored, and subject to upward medication dose adjustment as necessary to control BP . Reassessment includes BP measurement, detection of orthostatic hypotension in selected patients (eg, older or with postural symptoms), identification of white coat hypertension or a white coat effect, documentation of adherence, monitoring of the response to therapy, reinforcement of the importance of adherence, reinforcement of the importance of treatment, and assistance with treatment to achieve BP target.

Shared decision making, with the \npatient influenced by clinician judgment, should drive the ulti-\nmate choice of antihypertensive agent(s).\nMany patients started on a single agent will subsequently \nrequire ≥2 drugs from different pharmacological classes \nto reach their BP goals.\nS8.1.4-12,S8.1.4-13,S8.1.4-14 Knowledge of \nthe pharmacological mechanisms of action of each agent is important. Drug regimens with complementary activity, \nwhere a second antihypertensive agent is used to block com-\npensatory responses to the initial agent or affect a different \npressor mechanism, can result in additive lowering of BP.

For example, \n2 drugs from the same class should not be administered \ntogether (eg, 2 different beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, or nondihydropyridine CCBs). Likewise, 2 drugs from classes that target the same BP control system are less \neffective and potentially harmful when used together (eg, ACE inhibitors, ARBs). Exceptions to this rule in-\nclude concomitant use of a thiazide diuretic, K-sparing diuretic, and/or loop diuretic in various combinations. Also, dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine CCBs can \nbe combined.

Meta-\nanalyses and systematic reviews of these trials provide strong \nsupport for the more intensive approach, but the data are less \nclear in identification of a specific optimal BP target.S8.1.5-1–\nS8.1.5-5,S8.1.5-7,S8.1.5-11–S8.1.5-13 Recent trials that address optimal BP \ntargets include SPRINT and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes), with targets for more inten-\nsive (SBP <120 mm Hg) and standard (SBP <140 mm Hg) \ntreatment,\nS8.1.5-14,S8.1.5-15 and SPS-3, with a more intensive target \nof <130/80 mm Hg.S8.1.5-16 These trials yielded mixed results in \nachieving their primary endpoints. SPRINT was stopped early, \nafter a median follow-up of 3.26 years, when more intensive \ntreatment resulted in a significant reduction in the primary \noutcome (a CVD composite) and in all-cause mortality rate. In \nACCORD, more intensive BP treatment failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the primary outcome (a CVD com-posite). However, the incidence of stroke, a component of the \nprimary outcome, was significantly reduced.

CCBs have been \nshown to be as effective as diuretics for reducing all CVD events \nother than HF, and CCBs are a good alternative choice for initial \ntherapy when thiazide diuretics are not tolerated. Alpha block-\ners are not used as first-line therapy for hypertension because \nthey are less effective for prevention of CVD than other first-step \nagents, such as thiazide diuretics.\nS8.1.6-3,S8.1.6-10\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1.

Interpretation of meta-\nanalyses comparing agents from different drug classes is \nchallenging because the relevant RCTs were conducted in different time periods, during which concurrent antihyper -\ntensive therapy was less or more common, and the efficacy of agents from certain drug classes may have changed.

In contrast, some meta-analyses have suggested that beta blockers may be less effective, \nespecially for stroke prevention in older adults, but inter -\npretation is hampered by inclusion of RCTs that used beta blockers that are now considered to be inferior for preven-\ntion of CVD.\nS8.1.6-13,S8.1.6-14 In a systematic review and net-\nwork meta-analysis conducted for the present guideline, \nbeta blockers were significantly less effective than diuretics \nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nWhelton et al  2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline  e47\nfor prevention of stroke and cardiovascular events.S8.1.6-1 \nDiuretics were also significantly better than CCBs for pre-\nvention of HF.

Initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with a single antihypertensive drug is reasonable in adults with stage 1 hypertension and BP goal <130/80 mm Hg with dosage titration and sequential addition of other agents to achieve the BP target.\n*Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive medications are listed in Online \nData Supplement D.\nSynopsis\nSystematic review of the evidence comparing the initiation of \nantihypertensive treatment with monotherapy and sequential \n(stepped-care) titration of additional agents versus initiation \nof treatment with combination therapy (including fixed-dose combinations) did not identify any RCTs meeting the systematic review questions posed in the PICOTS format \n(P=population, I=intervention, C=comparator, O=outcome, \nT=timing, S=setting). However, in both ACCORD and SPRINT, 2-drug therapy was recommended for most partici-\npants in the intensive- but not standard-therapy groups.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Because most patients with hypertension require multiple \nagents for control of their BP and those with higher BPs \nare at greater risk, more rapid titration of antihyperten-sive medications began to be recommended in patients \nwith BP >20/10 mm Hg above their target, beginning with the JNC 7 report.\nS8.1.6.1-1 In these patients, initiation \nof antihypertensive therapy with 2 agents is recommend-\ned. Evidence favoring this approach comes mostly from \nstudies using fixed-dose combination products show-\ning greater BP lowering with fixed-dose combination \nagents than with single agents, as well as better adher -\nence to therapy.S8.1.6.1-2,S8.1.6.1-3 The safety and efficacy of \nthis strategy have been demonstrated in adults to reduce \nBPs to <140/90 mm Hg though not compared with other \nstrategies.S8.1.6.1-4–S8.1.6.1-6 In general, this approach is rea-\nsonable in older adults, those at high CVD risk, or those who have a history of hypotension or drug-associated \nside effects. However, caution is advised in initiating antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with 2 drugs in older patients because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension may develop in some patients; BP should be carefully monitored.\n2. The stepped-care approach defined by the initiation of an-\ntihypertensive drug therapy with a single agent followed \nby the sequential titration of the dose and addition of oth-er agents has been the recommended treatment strategy since the first report of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program.\nS8.1.6.1-7 This approach is also reason-\nable in older adults or those at risk or who have a history \nof hypotension or drug-associated side effects. This strat-\negy has been used successfully in nearly all hypertension \ntreatment trials but has not been formally tested against \nother antihypertensive drug treatment strategies for effec-\ntiveness in achieving BP control or in preventing adverse \noutcomes.\n8.2. Achieving BP Control in Individual Patients\nRecommendations for lifestyle modifications and drug selec-\ntion are specified in Sections 6.2, 8.1.4, and 8.1.6. Initial drug selections should be based on trial evidence of treatment effi-cacy, combined with recognition of compelling indications for use of an agent from a specific drug class, as well as the indi-vidual patient’s lifestyle preferences and traits. For a subset of patients (25% to 50%),\nS8.2-1 the initial drug therapy will be well \ntolerated and effective in achieving the desired level of BP, with only the need for subsequent monitoring (see",

For example, if hyponatremia is present, it would be important to avoid or stop thiazide diuretic therapy. In this case, a loop diuretic should be used if a diuretic is required. If hypokalemia is present, primary or secondary aldosteronism should be excluded, after which one should consider a potassium-sparing agent, such \nas spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride. In \naddition, reducing dietary sodium intake will diminish urinary potassium losses. If the patient has chronic cough or a history of ACE inhibitor–induced cough or develops a cough or bron-chial responsiveness while on an ACE inhibitor, one should use an ARB in place of an ACE inhibitor. For patients with bronchospastic lung disease, a beta-1-selective blocker (eg, \nbisoprolol, metoprolol) should be considered if beta-blocker \ntherapy is required. A patient who is already adherent to life-\nstyle change recommendations, including diligent reduction in \nsodium intake, may show a greater response to a RAS blocker. Prior patient experience should be considered, as in the case of cough associated with prior use of an ACE inhibitor, which is likely to reoccur if an agent from the same class is prescribed.\n8.3.

Diuretics are the only drugs used for the treatment of \nhypertension and HF that can adequately control the fluid retention of HF. Appropriate use of diuretics is also crucial to the success of other drugs used for the treatment of hypertension in the presence of HF. The use of inappropriately low doses of diuretics can result in fluid retention. Conversely, the use of inap-propriately high doses of diuretics can lead to volume contraction, which can increase the risk of hypotension and renal insufficiency. Diuretics should be prescribed to all patients with hypertension and HFp EF who have \nevidence of, and to most patients with a prior history of, \nfluid retention.\n2.

For many other common antihypertensive agents, including alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers, limited data ex-\nist to guide the choice of antihypertensive therapy in the \nsetting of HFp EF.\nS9.2.2-21 Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone \nsystem inhibition, however, with ACE inhibitor or ARB \nand especially MRA would represent the preferred \nchoice. A shared decision-making discussion, with the patient influenced by clinician judgment, should drive \nthe ultimate choice of antihypertensive agents.\n9.3.

Furthermore, CKD is not included in the CVD risk \ncalculations used to determine suitability for most clinical \ntrials.\nS9.3-26–S9.3-28\nUntil publication of the SPRINT results, most guidelines \nfor BP targets in patients with CKD favored treatment to a \nBP <140/90 mm Hg,S9.3-15 with consideration of the lower \ntarget of <130/80 mm Hg for those with more severe pro-teinuria (≥ 300 mg albuminuria in 24 hours or the equiva-\nlent), if tolerated.\nS9.3-16–S9.3-18 Patients with stage 3 to 4 CKD \n(eGFR of 20 to <60 mL/minute/1.73 m2) comprised 28% \nof the SPRINT study population, and in this group inten-sive BP management seemed to provide the same benefits \nfor reduction in the CVD composite primary outcome and all-cause mortality as were seen in the full study cohort. \nGiven that most patients with CKD die from CVD complica-\ntions, this RCT evidence supports a lower target of <130/80 mm Hg for all patients with CKD (Figure 6). It is appro-\npriate to acknowledge that many patients with CKD have \nadditional comorbidities and evidence of frailty that caused them to be excluded from past clinical trials. Observational \nstudies of CKD cohorts indicate a higher risk of mortality \nat lower systolic pressures and a flat relationship of SBP to event risk in elderly patients with CKD,\nS9.3-29,S9.3-30 which sup-\nports concerns that these complex patients may be at greater \nrisk of complications from intensive BP treatment and may \nfail to achieve benefits from lower BP targets. In contrast, in the prespecified subgroup analysis of the elderly cohort in \nSPRINT, frail elderly patients did sustain benefit from the \nlower BP target, which supports a lower goal for all patients, including those with CKD.\nS9.3-31 In this setting, incremental \nBP reduction may be appropriate, with careful monitoring of \nphysical and kidney function.\nAn ACE inhibitor (or an ARB, in case of ACE inhibitor \nintolerance) is a preferred drug for treatment of hyperten-sion if albuminuria (≥ 300 mg/day or ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine \nby first morning void) is present, although the evidence is  \nmixed\nS9.3-10,S9.3-11 (Figure 6). In the course of reducing intra-\nglomerular pressure and thereby reducing albuminuria, \nserum creatinine may increase up to 30% because of concur -\nrent reduction in GFR.S9.3-32 Further GFR decline should be \ninvestigated and may be related to other factors, including \nvolume contraction, use of nephrotoxic agents, or renovas-\ncular disease.S9.3-33 The combination of an ACE inhibitor and \nan ARB should be avoided because of reported harms dem-\nonstrated in several large cardiology trialsS9.3-34,S9.3-35 and in 1 \ndiabetic nephropathy trial.S9.3-36 Because of the greater risk \nof hyperkalemia and hypotension and lack of demonstrated benefit, the combination of an ARB (or ACE inhibitor) and a \ndirect renin inhibitor is also contraindicated during manage-\nment of patients with CKD.\nS9.3-37Figure 6 is an algorithm on management of hypertension in \npatients with CKD.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. We recommend ASCVD risk assessment in all adults \nwith hypertension, including those with CKD. As a matter of convenience, however, it can be assumed that the vast majority of patients with CKD have a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10%, placing them in the high risk cat-\negory that requires initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy at BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg (see",

More intensive BP treatment may result in a modest reduction in GFR, which is thought to be primarily due to a hemodynamic effect and may be reversible.

After kidney transplantation, it is reasonable \nto treat patients with hypertension to a BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg.\nS9.3.1-1 DBP: C-EO\nIIa B-R2. After kidney transplantation, it is reasonable to treat patients with hypertension with a calcium antagonist on the basis of improved GFR and kidney survival.\nS9.3.1-2\nSynopsis\nAfter kidney transplantation, hypertension is common because \nof preexisting kidney disease, the effects of immunosuppres-\nsive medications, and the presence of allograft pathology.S9.3.1-3 \nTransplant recipients frequently harbor multiple CVD risk fac-\ntors and are at high risk of CVD events. Hypertension may \naccelerate target organ damage and kidney function decline, \nparticularly when proteinuria is present.S9.3.1-4–S9.3.1-6\nUse of calcineurin inhibitor–based immunosuppression \nregimens after transplantation is associated with a high (70% \nto 90%) prevalence of hypertension.S9.3.1-7 Hypertension is less common when calcineurin inhibitors have been used \nwithout corticosteroids in liver transplantation patients,S9.3.1-8 \nalthough prevalence rates have not differed in steroid mini-\nmization trials after kidney transplantation.S9.3.1-9,S9.3.1-10 \nReports from long-term belatacept-based immunosuppres-sion studies indicate higher GFR and preservation of kid-\nney function. However, hypertension was still present in the majority of patients, although fewer agents were needed to achieve BP goals.\nS9.3.1-11 Severity of hypertension and inten-\nsity of treatment may differ somewhat depending on the \ntype of organ transplanted; however, most concepts relevant \nto kidney transplant recipients will apply to the other solid organ recipients as well.\nBP targets change over time after transplantation. Initially, \nit is important to maintain ample organ perfusion with less \nstringent BP targets (<160/90 mm Hg) to avoid hypoten-\nsion and risk of graft thrombosis. Beyond the first month, \nBP should be controlled to prevent target organ damage as in \nthe nontransplantation setting.\nS9.3.1-12,S9.3.1-13 Hypertension after \ntransplantation is often associated with altered circadian BP \nrhythm with loss of the normal nocturnal BP fallS9.3.1-14,S9.3.1-15 \nand, in some, a nocturnal BP rise. These changes may return to normal after a longer period of follow-up.\nS9.3.1-16\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Although treatment targets for hypertension after trans-\nplantation should probably be similar to those for other patients with CKD, there are no trials in post-transplan-tation patients comparing different BP targets. As kidney transplant recipients generally have a single functioning kidney and CKD, BP targets should be similar to those for the general CKD population.\n2. Limited studies have compared drug choice for initial antihypertensive therapy in patients after kidney trans-plantation. On the basis of a Cochrane analysis,\nS9.3.1-2 \nmost studies favor CCBs to reduce graft loss and main-tain higher GFR, with some evidence suggesting poten-tial harm from ACE inhibitors because of anemia, hyper -\nkalemia, and lower GFR. In recognition of this concern, \nRAS inhibitors may be reserved for the subset of patients \nwith hypertension and additional comorbidities that sup-\nport the need for ACE inhibitor therapy (ie, proteinuria \nor HF after transplantation). With appropriate potassium \nand creatinine monitoring, this has been demonstrated to be safe.\nS9.3.1-17\n9.4. Cerebrovascular Disease\nStroke is a leading cause of death, disability, and dementia.S9.4-1 \nBecause of its heterogeneous causes and hemodynamic con-\nsequences, the management of BP in adults with stroke is \ncomplex and challenging.S9.4-2 To accommodate the variety of \nimportant issues pertaining to BP management in the stroke \npatient, treatment recommendations require recognition of \nstroke acuity, stroke type, and therapeutic objectives. Future studies should target more narrowly defined questions, such as optimal BP-reduction timing and target, as well as ideal \nantihypertensive agent therapeutic class by patient type and \nevent type.\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\ne54  Hypertension  June 2018\n9.4.1.

In adults with ICH who present with SBP \ngreater than 220 mm Hg, it is reasonable to use continuous intravenous drug infusion (Table 19) and close BP monitoring to lower SBP.\nIII: Harm A2. Immediate lowering of SBP (Table 19) to less than 140 mm Hg in adults with spontaneous ICH who present within 6 hours of the acute event and have an SBP between 150 mm Hg and 220 mm Hg is not of benefit to reduce death or severe disability and can be potentially harmful.\nS9.4.1-1,S9.4.1-2\nSynopsis\nSpontaneous, nontraumatic ICH is a significant global cause of \nmorbidity and mortality.S9.4.1-3 Elevated BP is highly prevalent \nin the setting of acute ICH and is linked to greater hematoma \nexpansion, neurological worsening, and death and dependency \nafter ICH.\nFigure 7 is an algorithm on management of hypertension in \npatients with acute ICH.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Information about the safety and effectiveness of early \nintensive BP-lowering treatment is least well established \nfor patients with markedly elevated BP (sustained SBP \n>220 mm Hg) on presentation, patients with large and \nsevere ICH, or patients requiring surgical decompres-\nsion. However, given the consistent nature of the data \nlinking high BP with poor clinical outcomesS9.4.1-4–S9.4.1-6  \nand some suggestive data for treatment in patients with modestly high initial SBP levels,\nS9.4.1-1,S9.4.1-7 early lowering of SBP in ICH patients with markedly high \nSBP levels (>220 mm Hg) might be sensible. A second-ary endpoint in 1 RCT and an overview of data from 4 \nRCTs indicate that intensive BP reduction, versus BP-\nlowering guideline treatment, is associated with greater functional recovery at 3 months.\nS9.4.1-1,S9.4.1-7\n2. RCT data have suggested that immediate BP lowering \n(to <140/90 mm Hg) within 6 hours of an acute ICH \nwas feasible and safe,S9.4.1-1,S9.4.1-8,S9.4.1-9 may be linked to \ngreater attenuation of absolute hematoma growth at 24 hours,\nS9.4.1-7 and might be associated with modestly better \nfunctional recovery in survivors.S9.4.1-1,S9.4.1-7 However, a \nrecent RCTS9.4.1-2 that examined immediate BP lowering \nwithin 4.5 hours of an acute ICH found that treatment to achieve a target SBP of 110 to 139 mm Hg did not lead to a lower rate of death or disability than standard reduction \nto a target of 140 to 179 mm Hg. Moreover, there were \nsignificantly more renal adverse events within 7 days af-ter randomization in the intensive-treatment group than \nin the standard-treatment group.\nS9.4.1-2 Put together, nei-\nther of the 2 key trialsS9.4.1-1,S9.4.1-2 evaluating the effect of \nlowering SBP in the acute period after spontaneous ICH met their primary outcomes of reducing death and severe \ndisability at 3 months.\n9.4.2. Acute Ischemic Stroke\nRecommendations for Management of Hypertension in \nPatients With Acute Ischemic Stroke\nReferences that support recommendations are summarized \nin Online Data Supplement 42.\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nI B-NR1. Adults with acute ischemic stroke and \nelevated BP who are eligible for treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator should have their BP slowly lowered to less than 185/110 mm Hg before thrombolytic therapy is initiated.\nS9.4.2-1,S9.4.2-2\nI B-NR2. In adults with an acute ischemic stroke, BP should be less than 185/110 mm Hg before administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and should be maintained below 180/105 mm Hg for at least the first 24 hours after initiating drug therapy.\nS9.4.2-3\nIIa B-NR3. Starting or restarting antihypertensive therapy during hospitalization in patients with BP greater than 140/90 mm Hg who are neurologically stable is safe and reasonable to improve long-term BP control, unless contraindicated.\nS9.4.2-4,S9.4.2-5\nIIb C-EO4. In patients with BP of 220/120 mm Hg or higher who did not receive intravenous alteplase or endovascular treatment and have no comorbid conditions requiring acute antihypertensive treatment, the benefit of initiating or reinitiating treatment of hypertension within the first 48 to 72 hours is uncertain. It might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours after onset of stroke.Figure 7. Management of hypertension in patients with acute \nICH.

In patients with BP less than 220/120 \nmm Hg who did not receive intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment and do not have a comorbid condition requiring acute antihypertensive treatment, initiating or reinitiating treatment of hypertension within the first 48 to 72 hours after an acute ischemic stroke is not effective to prevent death or dependency.\nS9.4.2-4–S9.4.2-9\nSynopsis\nElevated BP is common during acute ischemic stroke \n(occurring in up to 80% of patients), especially among \npatients with a history of hypertension.S9.4.2-10 However, \nBP often decreases spontaneously during the acute phase of ischemic stroke, as soon as 90 minutes after the onset \nof symptoms. Countervailing theoretical concerns about arterial hypertension during acute ischemic stroke include \naiming to enhance cerebral perfusion of the ischemic tissue \nwhile minimizing the exacerbation of brain edema and hem-\norrhagic transformation of the ischemic tissue.\nS9.4.2-11,S9.4.2-12 \nSome studies have shown a U-shaped relationship between the admission BP and favorable clinical outcomes, with an \noptimal SBP and DBP ranging from 121 to 200 mm Hg and 81 to 110 mm Hg, respectively.\nS9.4.2-13 It is conceivable that \nan optimal arterial BP range exists during acute ischemic \nstroke on an individual basis, contingent on the ischemic stroke subtype and other patient-specific comorbidities. \nEarly initiation or resumption of antihypertensive treatment \nafter acute ischemic stroke is indicated only in specific \nsituations: 1) patients treated with tissue-type plasminogen  \nactivator,S9.4.2-1,S9.4.2-2 and 2) patients with SBP >220 mm Hg \nor DBP >120 mm Hg. For the latter group, it should be kept \nin mind that cerebral autoregulation in the ischemic penumbra \nof the stroke is grossly abnormal and that systemic perfusion pressure is needed for blood flow and oxygen delivery. Rapid \nreduction of BP, even to lower levels within the hypertensive \nrange, can be detrimental. For all other acute ischemic stroke \npatients, the advantage of lowering BP early to reduce death \nand dependency is uncertain,\nS9.4.2-4–S9.4.2-9 but restarting antihy-\npertensive therapy to improve long-term BP control is reason-\nable after the first 24 hours for patients who have preexisting \nhypertension and are neurologically stable.S9.4.2-4,S9.4.2-5,S9.4.2-14\nFigure 8 is an algorithm on management of hypertension in \npatients with acute ischemic stroke.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1.

In adults previously untreated for hypertension who experience an ischemic stroke or TIA and have a SBP less than 140 mm Hg and a DBP less than 90 mm Hg, the usefulness of initiating antihypertensive treatment is not well established.\nS9.4.3-9Synopsis\nEach year in the United States, >750 000 adult patients experi-\nence a stroke, of which up to 25% are recurrent strokes.S9.4.3-10 \nFor an individual who experiences an initial stroke or TIA, the \nannual risk of a subsequent or “secondary” stroke is approxi-mately 4%,\nS9.4.3-11 and the case mortality rate is 41% after a \nrecurrent stroke versus 22% after an initial stroke.S9.4.3-12 Among \npatients with a recent stroke or TIA, the prevalence of premor -\nbid hypertension is approximately 70%.S9.4.3-13 Risk of recurrent \nstroke is heightened by presence of elevated BP, and guideline-recommended antihypertensive drug treatment to lower BP has been linked to a reduction in 1-year recurrent stroke risk.\nS9.4.3-14 \nRCT meta-analyses show an approximately 30% decrease in \nrecurrent stroke risk with BP-lowering therapies.S9.4.3-1–S9.4.3-3 An \nissue frequently raised by clinicians is whether the presence of \nclinically asymptomatic cerebral infarction incidentally noted on brain imaging (computed tomography or MRI scan) in patients without a history of or symptoms of a stroke or TIA warrants implementation of secondary stroke prevention measures. \nClinically asymptomatic vascular brain injury is increasingly \nbeing considered as an entry point for secondary stroke preven-tion therapies, because these apparently “silent” brain infarctions are associated with typical stroke risk factors, accumulatively lead to subtle neurological impairments, and bolster risk of future symptomatic stroke events.\nS9.4.3-15 Although the evidence \nfor using antihypertensive treatment to prevent recurrent stroke in stroke patients with elevated BP is compelling,\nS9.4.3-1–S9.4.3-3 \nquestions remain about when precisely after an index stroke to initiate it, what specific agent(s) to use (if any), which therapeu-tic targets to aim for, and whether the treatment approach should vary by index stroke mechanism and baseline level of BP.\nS9.4.3-16\nFigure 9 is an algorithm on management of hypertension \nin patients with a previous history of stroke (secondary stroke prevention).\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Two overviews of RCTs published through 2009 showed \nthat antihypertensive medications lowered the risk of recurrent vascular events in patients with stroke or TIA.\nS9.4.3-1–S9.4.3-3\n2. Specific agents that have shown benefit in either dedi-cated RCTs or systematic reviews of RCT data include diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs.\n3. Support for this recommendation is based on data from 2 dedicated RCTs, as well as a systematic review and meta-analysis, among patients with a history of stroke or TIA.\nS9.4.3-1–S9.4.3-3\n4. Reduction in BP appears to be more important than the choice of specific agents used to achieve this goal. Thus, if diuretic and ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment do not achieve BP target, other agents, such as CCB and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, may be added.\n5. An overview of RCTs showed that larger reductions in SBP tended to be associated with greater reduction in risk of recurrent stroke. However, a separate overview \nof RCTs in patients who experienced a stroke noted that \nachieving an SBP level <130 mm Hg was not associ-\nated with a lower stroke risk, and several observational \nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nWhelton et al  2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline  e57\nstudies did not show benefit with achieved SBP levels \n<120 mm Hg.S9.4.3-5\n6. Patients with a lacunar stroke treated to an SBP target of <130 mm Hg versus 130 to 140 mm Hg may be less \nlikely to experience a future ICH.\n7. No published RCTs have specifically addressed this \nquestion, but a post hoc analysis of an RCT suggests that the effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment for sec-\nondary stroke prevention diminishes as initial baseline \nBP declines.\nS9.4.3-9\n9.5.

No RCTs have explicitly 1) docu-\nmented whether treatment to an SBP goal <140 mm Hg versus \na higher goal improves clinical outcomes in adults with hyper -\ntension and DM or 2) directly evaluated clinical outcomes \nassociated with SBP <130 mm Hg.S9.6-2 However, 2 high-qual-\nity systematic reviews of RCTs support an SBP target of <140 \nmm Hg.S9.6-4,S9.6-7\nThere is little or no available RCT evidence supporting a \nspecific DBP threshold for initiation of pharmacological ther -\napy.

The ACCORD trial,\nS9.6-5 \nwhich compared CVD outcomes in adults with DM and hypertension who were randomized to an SBP target of <140 mm Hg (standard therapy) or <120 mm Hg \n(intensive therapy), did not document a significant re-\nduction in the primary outcome (CVD composite) with the lower BP goal, but the trial was underpowered to detect a statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment arms. The ACCORD trial demonstrated a small reduction in absolute risk (1.1%) for stroke, but there were few such events. More adverse events (2% increase in absolute risk) were identified in the lower \nBP group, especially self-reported hypotension and a \nreduction in estimated GFR, but these did not result in an excess of stroke or ESRD. The ACCORD trial was a factorial study; secondary analysis demonstrat-ed a significant outcome benefit in the intensive BP/standard glycemic group,\nS9.6-3 but benefit in the inten-\nsive BP/intensive glycemic control group was no bet-ter than in the intensive BP/standard glycemic control group, which suggests a floor benefit beyond which the \ncombined intensive interventions were ineffective.\nS9.6-5 \nAn ACCORD secondary analysis suggested that an \nSBP <120 mm Hg is superior to standard BP control in reducing LVH.\nS9.6-6\nA meta-analysis of 73 913 patients with DM reported \nthat an SBP <130 mm Hg reduced stroke by 39%.

Metabolic Syndrome\nMetabolic syndrome is a state of metabolic dysregulation \ncharacterized by visceral fat accumulation, insulin resis-tance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia, as well as pre-disposition to type 2 DM, hypertension, and atherosclerotic  \nCVD.\nS9.7-1–S9.7-3 According to data from the NHANES III and \nNHANES 1999–2006,S9.7-1,S9.7-4 the prevalence of metabolic \nsyndrome in the United States was 34.2% in 2006 and has likely increased substantially since that time. The metabolic syndrome is linked to several other disorders, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, certain cancers, CKD, Alzheimer’s disease, Cushing’s syndrome, \nlipodystrophy, and hyperalimentation.\nS9.7-5,S9.7-6\nLifestyle modification, with an emphasis on improv-\ning insulin sensitivity by means of dietary modification, \nweight reduction, and exercise, is the foundation of treat-ment of the metabolic syndrome. The optimal antihyper -\ntensive drug therapy for patients with hypertension in the \nsetting of the metabolic syndrome has not been clearly \ndefined.\nS9.7-1 Although caution exists with regard to the use \nof thiazide diuretics in this population because of their abil-ity to increase insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyper -\nuricemia and to accelerate conversion to overt DM, no data are currently available demonstrating deterioration in car -\ndiovascular or renal outcomes in patients treated with these agents.\nS9.7-1 Indeed, as shown in follow-up of ALLHAT, \nchlorthalidone use was associated with only a small increase in fasting glucose levels (1.5–4.0 mg/dL), and this increase did not translate into increased CVD risk at a later date.\nS9.7-7–\nS9.7-10 In addition, in post hoc analysis of the nearly two thirds \nof participants in ALLHAT that met criteria for the meta-bolic syndrome, chlorthalidone was unsurpassed in reducing CVD and renal outcomes compared with lisinopril, amlo-dipine, or doxazosin.\nS9.7-9,S9.7-11 Similarly, high-dose ARB \ntherapy reduces arterial stiffness in patients with hyperten-sion with the metabolic syndrome, but no outcomes data are available from patients in which this form of treatment was \nused.\nS9.7-12 Use of traditional beta blockers may lead to dys-\nlipidemia or deterioration of glucose tolerance, and ability \nto lose weight.S9.7-2 In several large clinical trials, the risk of \ndeveloping DM as a result of traditional beta-blocker therapy was 15% to 29%.\nS9.7-2 However, the newer vasodilating beta \nblockers (eg, labetalol, carvedilol, nebivolol) have shown neutral or favorable effects on metabolic profiles compared with the traditional beta blockers.\nS9.7-13 Trials using vasodila-\ntor beta blockers have not been performed to demonstrate effects on CVD outcomes.9.8. Atrial Fibrillation\nRecommendation for Treatment of Hypertension in Patients \nWith AF\nReferences that support the recommendation are \nsummarized in Online Data Supplement 48.\nCOR LOE Recommendation\nIIa B-R1. Treatment of hypertension with an ARB  \ncan be useful for prevention of recurrence  of AF.\nS9.8-1,S9.8-2\nSynopsis\nAF and hypertension are common and often coexistent con-\nditions, both of which increase in frequency with age. AF occurs in 3% to 4% of the population >65 years of age.\nS9.8-3 \nHypertension is present in >80% of patients with AF and is by far the most common comorbid condition, regardless of age.\nS9.8-4 AF is associated with systemic thromboembolism, \nas recognized in the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-V ASc scoring systems for stroke risk.\nS9.8-5 It is also associated with gradual \nworsening of ventricular function, the subsequent development \nof HF, and increased mortality.\nHypertension has long been recognized as a risk factor \nfor AF because it is associated with LVH, decreased diastolic \nfunction with impaired LV filling, rising left atrial pressures \nwith left atrial hypertrophy and enlargement, increased atrial \nfibrosis, and slowing of intra-atrial and interatrial electrical conduction velocities. Such a distortion of atrial anatomy and \nphysiology increases the incidence of AF.\nS9.8-6 Left atrial pres-\nsure also increases with ischemic or valvular heart disease and \nmyopathies that are often associated with systemic hyperten-\nsion, potentially leading to AF.\nAlthough management of AF will continue to revolve \naround restoration of sinus rhythm when appropriate, rate con-trol when it is not, and anticoagulation, control of hypertension \nis a key component of therapy.\nS9.8-1,S9.8-2\nTreatment of hypertension may prevent new-onset AF, espe-\ncially in patients with LVH or LV dysfunction.S9.8-1 Five RCTs \nhave compared the value of antihypertensive agents for reduc-\ntion of new-onset AF.S9.8-7–S9.8-11 One study suggested superiority \nof RAS blockade over a CCB,S9.8-8 and another reported supe-\nriority of RAS blockade over a beta blocker that is no longer \nrecommended for treatment of hypertension.S9.8-9 In the largest \ntrial, there was no difference in incident AF among adults with hypertension assigned to first-step therapy with a diuretic, ACE inhibitor, or CCB.\nS9.8-10 In ALLHAT, the incidence of AF was \n23% higher during first-step antihypertensive therapy with the alpha-receptor blocker doxazosin than with chlorthalidone. Furthermore, the occurrence of AF or atrial flutter during the study, either new onset or recurrent, was associated with an \nincrease in mortality of nearly 2.5-fold.\nS9.8-10\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Although RAS blockade in theory is the treatment of choice \nfor hypertension in patients with prior AF, relative to other \nclasses of agents, all of the trials that have shown clinical \nsuperiority of ARBs over other agents were comparisons \nwith CCBs or beta blockers that are no longer recommended \nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\ne60  Hypertension  June 2018\nas first-line agents for treatment of hypertension.S9.8-2 There \nare no available trials comparing ACE inhibitors with  \nother drugs or any RAS-blocking agents with diuretics.\n9.9. Valvular Heart Disease\nRecommendations for Treatment of Hypertension in \nPatients With Valvular Heart Disease\nReferences that support recommendations are summarized \nin Online Data Supplements 49 and 50.\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nI B-NR1. In adults with asymptomatic aortic \nstenosis, hypertension should be treated with pharmacotherapy, starting at a low dose and gradually titrating upward as needed.\nS9.9-1–S9.9-4\nIIa C-LD2. In patients with chronic aortic insufficiency, treatment of systolic hypertension with agents that do not slow the heart rate (ie, avoid beta blockers) is reasonable.\nS9.9-5,S9.9-6\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Hypertension is a risk factor for the development of \naortic stenosis (stage A [eg, aortic sclerosis or bicuspid aortic valve]) and asymptomatic aortic stenosis (stage B [progressive asymptomatic aortic stenosis]). The combi-nation of hypertension and aortic stenosis, “2 resistors in \nseries,” increases the rate of complications. In patients \nwith asymptomatic mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis, hypertension has been associated with more abnormal LV structure and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.\nS9.9-1 There is no evidence that antihypertensive \nmedications will produce an inordinate degree of hypo-tension in patients with aortic stenosis. Nitroprusside \ninfusion in hypertensive patients with severe aortic ste-\nnosis lowers pulmonary and systemic resistance, with improvements in stroke volume and LV end-diastolic pressure.\nS9.9-2 Thus, careful use of antihypertensive agents \nto achieve BP control in patients with hypertension and aortic stenosis is beneficial. Although there are no spe-cific trials comparing various classes of antihypertensive agents, RAS blockade may be advantageous because of \nthe potentially beneficial effects on LV fibrosis,\nS9.9-3 con-\ntrol of hypertension, reduction of dyspnea, and improved \neffort tolerance.S9.9-4 Diuretics should be used sparingly \nin patients with small LV chamber dimensions. Beta blockers may be appropriate for patients with aortic stenosis who have reduced ejection fraction, prior MI, arrhythmias, or angina pectoris. In patients with mod-\nerate or severe aortic stenosis, consultation or co-man-\nagement with a cardiologist is preferred for hypertension management.\n2. Vasodilator therapy can reduce the LV volume and mass and improve LV performance in patients with aortic regurgitation,\nS9.9-5 but improvement of long-term clinical \noutcomes, such as time to valve replacement, have been \nvariable.S9.9-5,S9.9-6 Beta blockers may result in increased \ndiastolic filling period because of bradycardia, poten-\ntially causing increased aortic insufficiency. Marked reduction in DBP may lower coronary perfusion pres-\nsure in patients with chronic severe aortic regurgitation (stage B [progressive asymptomatic aortic regurgita-\ntion] and stage C [asymptomatic severe AR]). However, there are no outcomes data to support these theoretical concerns.\n9.10. Aortic Disease\nRecommendation for Management of Hypertension in \nPatients With Aortic Disease\nCOR LOE Recommendation\nI C-EO1. Beta blockers are recommended as the \npreferred antihypertensive agents in patients with hypertension and thoracic aortic disease.\nS9.10-1,S9.10-2\nSynopsis\nThoracic aortic aneurysms are generally asymptomatic until \na person presents with a sudden catastrophic event, such as an aortic dissection or rupture, which is rapidly fatal in the majority of patients.\nS9.10-3,S9.10-4 The rationale for antihyperten-\nsive therapy is based largely on animal and observational stud-ies associating hypertension with aortic dissection.\nS9.10-5,S9.10-6  \nRCTs specifically addressing hypertension and aortic dis -\nease are not available, and trials in patients with primary \nhypertension do not provide insight on either the optimal BP \ntarget or choice of antihypertensive drug therapy in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, or aortic disease.\nS9.10-7,S9.10-8 A study in 20 humans with hypertension \nsuggested that hypertension is associated with significant changes in the mechanical properties of the aortic wall, with \nmore strain-induced stiffening in hypertension than in normo-\ntension, which may reflect destruction of elastin and predispo-sition to aortic dissection in the presence of hypertension.\nS9.10-9 \nIn a retrospective observational study, high BP variability was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of aortic \ndissection.\nS9.10-10 Recommendations for treatment of acute aor -\ntic dissection are provided in",

Hypertension control \nrates are lower for blacks, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans than for whites.\nS10.1-1 Among men with hyperten-\nsion, non-Hispanic white (53.8%) adults had a higher preva-lence of controlled high blood pressure than did non-Hispanic black (43.8%), non-Hispanic Asian (39.9%), and Hispanic (43.5%) adults. For women with hypertension, the percentage \nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nWhelton et al  2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline  e61\nof non-Hispanic white (59.1%) adults with controlled high \nblood pressure was higher than among non-Hispanic black (52.3%) and non-Hispanic Asian (46.8%) adults.\nS10.1-1 In \nHispanic Americans, the lower control rates result primar -\nily from lack of awareness and treatment,S10.1-2,S10.1-3 whereas \nin blacks, awareness and treatment are at least as high as in \nwhites, but hypertension is more severe and some agents are \nless effective at BP control.S10.1-4 Morbidity and mortality \nattributed to hypertension are also more common in blacks and Hispanic Americans than in whites. Blacks have a 1.3-times greater risk of nonfatal stroke, 1.8-times greater risk \nof fatal strokes, 1.5-times greater risk of HF, and 4.2-times \ngreater risk of ESRD.\nS10.1-4 Hispanic Americans have lower \nrates of hypertension awareness and treatment than those of \nwhites and blacks, as well as a high prevalence of comorbid CVD risk factors (eg, obesity, DM). In 2014, age-adjusted \nhypertension-attributable mortality rates per 1 000 persons \nfor non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic-\nAmerican men and women were 19.3 and 15.8, 50.1 and 35.6, and 19.1 and 14.6, respectively.\nS10.1-5 However, Hispanics in \nthe United States are a heterogeneous subgroup, and rates of both hypertension and its consequences vary according to whether their ancestry is from the Caribbean, Mexico, Central or South America, or Europe.\nS10.1-6–S10.1-8 Hispanics from \nMexico and Central America have lower CVD rates than US whites, whereas those of Caribbean origin have higher rates. Thus, pooling of data for Hispanics may not accurately reflect risk in a given patient. Finally, the excess risk of CKD out-comes in at least some blacks with hypertension may be due to the presence of high-risk APOL1 (apolipoprotein L1) genetic variants.\nS10.1-9–S10.1-11 The rate of renal decline associated with \nthis genotype appears to be largely unresponsive to either BP lowering or RAS inhibition.\nS10.1-9–S10.1-12\n10.1.1.

In black adults with hypertension but \nwithout HF or CKD, including those with DM, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB.\nS10.1.1-1–S10.1.1-4\nI C-LD2. Two or more antihypertensive medications are recommended to achieve a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg in most adults with hypertension, especially in black adults with hypertension.\nS10.1.1-5–S10.1.1-7\nSynopsis\nLifestyle modification (ie, weight reduction, dietary modifica-\ntion, and increased physical activity) is particularly important in blacks and Hispanic Americans for prevention and first-line or adjunctive therapy of hypertension (see Sections 12.1.2 and 12.1.3). However, the adoption of lifestyle recommendations is often challenging in ethnic minority patients because of poor social support, limited access to exercise opportunities and healthy foods, and financial considerations. The greater prev-\nalence of lower socioeconomic status may impede access to basic living necessities,\nS10.1.1-8 including medical care and medi-\ncations. Consideration must also be given to learning styles and preference, personal beliefs, values, and culture.\nS10.1.1-9,S10.1.1-10\nThe principles of antihypertensive drug selection discussed  \nin Sections 8.1.4 through 8.1.6 apply to ethnic minorities with a few caveats. In blacks, thiazide-type diuretics and CCBs are more effective in lowering BP when given as monother -\napy or as initial agents in multidrug regimens.\nS10.1.1-11–S10.1.1-13  \nIn addition, thiazide-type agents are superior to drugs that \ninhibit the RAS (ie, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, renin inhibitors, \nand beta blockers) for prevention of selected clinical out-\ncomes in blacks.S10.1.1-2,S10.1.1-14–S10.1.1-16 For optimum endpoint \nprotection, the thiazide chlorthalidone should be administered at a dose of 12.5 to 25 mg/day (or 25–50 mg/d for hydro-chlorothiazide) because lower doses are either unproven or less effective in clinical outcome trials.\nS10.1.1-2,S10.1.1-16 The CCB \namlodipine is as effective as chlorthalidone and more effective than the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in reducing BP, CVD, and stroke events but less effective in preventing HF. Blacks have a greater risk of angioedema with ACE inhibitors,\nS10.1.1-2,S10.1.1-3  \nand Asian Americans have a higher incidence of ACE inhibi-tor–induced cough.\nS10.1.1-17 ACE inhibitors and ARBs are \nrecommended more generally as components of multidrug \nantihypertensive regimens in blacks with CKD (see",

Most patients with \nhypertension, especially blacks, require ≥2 antihypertensive \nmedications to achieve adequate BP control.

Racial \nand ethnic differences should not be the basis for excluding \nany class of antihypertensive agent in combination therapy.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. In blacks, thiazide diuretics or CCBs are more effective \nin lowering BP than are RAS inhibitors or beta block-\ners and more effective in reducing CVD events than are RAS inhibitors or alpha blockers.

WomenA potential limitation of RCTs, including SPRINT, is that they \nare not specifically powered to determine the value of inten-sive SBP reduction in subgroups, including women in the case of SPRINT. However, in prespecified analyses, there was no \nevidence of an interaction between sex and treatment effect. \nFurthermore, no significant differences in CVD outcomes were observed between men and women in a large meta-\nanalysis that included 31 RCTs with about 100 000 men and \n90 000 women with hypertension.\nS10.2.1-1 Some have called for \na SPRINT-like trial with sufficient power to assess the effects \nof intensive SBP reduction in women.S10.2.1-2 In meta-analyses, \nthere was no convincing evidence that different antihyperten-sive drug classes exerted sex-related differences in BP low-ering or provided distinct CVD protection.\nS10.2.1-1 Calcium \nantagonists offered slightly greater benefits for stroke preven-\ntion than did ACE inhibitors for women than for men, whereas \ncalcium antagonists reduced all-cause deaths compared with placebo in men but not in women. However, these sex-related \ndifferences might have been due to chance because of the large \nnumber of statistical comparisons that were performed. The Heart Attack Trial and Hypertension Care Computing Project reported that beta blockers were associated with reduced mor -\ntality in men but not in women, but this finding was likely due to the low event rates in women.\nS10.2.1-3 Similarly, in the \nopen-label Second Australian National BP study, a significant \nreduction in CVD events was demonstrated in men but not in \nwomen with ACE inhibitors versus diuretics.S10.2.1-4\nAdverse effects of antihypertensive therapy were noted \ntwice as often in women as in men in the TOMHS study.S10.2.1-5 \nA higher incidence of ACE inhibitor–induced cough and of \nedema with calcium antagonists was observed in women than \nin men.S10.2.1-6 Women were more likely to experience hypoka-\nlemia and hyponatremia and less likely to experience gout with diuretics.\nS10.2.1-7 Hypertension in pregnancy has special require-\nments (see",

Pregnancy\nRecommendations for Treatment of Hypertension in  \nPregnancy\nReferences that support recommendations are summarized \nin Online Data Supplement 53.\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nI C-LD1. Women with hypertension who become \npregnant, or are planning to become pregnant, should be transitioned to methyldopa, nifedipine, and/or labetalol\nS10.2.2-1 \nduring pregnancy.S10.2.2-2–S10.2.2-6\nIII: Harm C-LD2. Women with hypertension who become pregnant should not be treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or direct renin inhibitors.\nS10.2.2-4–S10.2.2-6Synopsis\nBP usually declines during the first trimester of pregnancy \nand then slowly rises. Hypertension management during \npregnancy includes 4 general areas: 1) the newly pregnant \nmother with existing hypertension; 2) incident hyperten-\nsion; 3) preeclampsia (a dangerous form of hypertension \nwith proteinuria that has the potential to result in serious adverse consequences for the mother [stroke, HF] and fetus \n[small for gestational age, premature birth]); and 4) severe hypertension, often in the setting of preeclampsia, requir -\ning urgent treatment to prevent HF, stroke, and adverse fetal outcomes. Hypertension during pregnancy and preeclamp-\nsia are recognized as risk factors for future hypertension \nand CVD.\nS10.2.2-7–S10.2.2-9 BP management during pregnancy is \ncomplicated by the fact that many commonly used antihy-pertensive agents, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs, are \ncontraindicated during pregnancy because of potential harm \nto the fetus.\nS10.2.2-2,S10.2.2-3 The goal of antihypertensive treat-\nment during pregnancy includes prevention of severe hyper -\ntension and the possibility of prolonging gestation to allow the fetus more time to mature before delivery.\nThere are 3 Cochrane database reviews of treatment for  \nmild-to-moderate hypertension during pregnancy.\nS10.2.2-10–S10.2.2-12  \nWith regard to the treatment of mild-to-moderate hyperten-\nsion (SBP of 140–169 or DBP of 90–109 mm Hg), anti-\nhypertensive treatment reduces the risk of progression to severe hypertension by 50% compared with placebo but has not been shown to prevent preeclampsia, preterm birth, \nsmall for gestational age, or infant mortality. Beta blockers and CCBs appear superior to alpha-methyldopa in prevent-\ning preeclampsia.\nS10.2.2-10 An earlier review of 2 small trials \ndid not show improved outcomes with more comprehen-\nsive treatment of BP to a target of <130/80 mm Hg.S10.2.2-11 \nConsistent with the results of the Cochrane reviews, a large \nmultinational RCT of treatment in pregnant women with \nmild-to-moderate hypertension also reported that treat-\nment prevented progression to severe hypertension, but other maternal and infant outcomes were unaffected by the \nintensity of treatment.\nS10.2.2-13 An earlier review confined to \nassessing the effect of beta blockers found them generally safe and effective but of no benefit for newborn outcomes, \neither in placebo-controlled studies or when compared with \nother antihypertensive agents. There was a suggestion that \nbeta-blocker therapy might be associated with small for \ngestational age and neonatal bradycardia.\nS10.2.2-12 The larg-\nest experience for beta blockers is with labetalol; the larg-est experience for CCBs is with nifedipine. Methyldopa and \nhydralazine may also be used. A review of treatment for \npregnancy-associated severe hypertension found insufficient \nevidence to recommend specific agents; rather, clinician experience was recommended in this setting.\nS10.2.2-14\nPreeclampsia is a potentially dangerous condition for the \npregnant woman and fetus, occurring in 3.8% of pregnancies, and preeclampsia and eclampsia account for 9% of maternal \ndeaths in the United States.\nS10.2.2-15 Preeclampsia is associ-\nated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption, and perinatal mortality \nand is twice as likely to occur in the first pregnancy. The US \nPreventive Services Task Force has recommended screening \nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nWhelton et al  2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline  e63\nall pregnant women for preeclampsia by measuring BP at \nevery prenatal visit.S10.2.2-16\nIt is beyond the scope of the present guideline to address \nthe management of hypertension during pregnancy in detail. \nSeveral international guidelines provide guidance on manage-\nment of hypertension during pregnancy.S10.2.2-2,S10.2.2-3,S10.2.2-17 \nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \nhas issued a task force report that includes recommenda-tions for prevention (aspirin in selected cases) and treatment \n(magnesium for severe hypertension) of hypertension in pregnancy.\nS10.2.2-2 A report detailing treatment of hypertensive \nemergencies during pregnancy and postpartum has also been \nreleased.S10.2.2-2,S10.2.2-17,S10.2.2-18\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not approved for use during \npregnancy; they are fetotoxic. Among the agents recom-mended, no specific agent is first choice because there are \nno data supporting one over another. Therapeutic classes \nare not recommended because potential toxicity differs \namong agents within classes.\n2. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are fetotoxic in the second and \nthird trimesters of pregnancy. Adverse effects in the first \ntrimester of pregnancy may be secondary to hypertension \nor the medication.\nS10.2.2-4,S10.2.2-5 Adverse events in the later \ntrimesters have been suggested by observational data and \nmeta-analyses.S10.2.2-6 For ARBs, case reports with effects \nsimilar to ACE inhibitors have been published.S10.2.2-19\n10.3. Age-Related Issues\n10.3.1. Older Persons\nRecommendations for Treatment of Hypertension  \nin Older Persons\nReferences that support recommendations are summarized \nin Online Data Supplement 54.\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nI A1. Treatment of hypertension with a SBP \ntreatment goal of less than 130 mm Hg is recommended for noninstitutionalized ambulatory community-dwelling adults (≥65 years of age) with an average SBP of 130 mm Hg or higher.\nS10.3.1-1\nIIa C-EO2. For older adults (≥65 years of age) with hypertension and a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based approach to assess risk/benefit is reasonable for decisions regarding intensity of BP lowering and choice of antihypertensive drugs.\nSynopsis\nBecause of its extremely high prevalence in older adults, hyper -\ntension is not only a leading cause of preventable morbidity and \nmortality but, perhaps more importantly, is under-recognized \nas a major contributor to premature disability and institution\nalization.S10.3.1-2–S10.3.1-5 Both SBP and DBP increase linearly up \nto the fifth or sixth decade of life, after which DBP gradually decreases while SBP continues to rise.S10.3.1-6 Thus, isolated \nsystolic hypertension is the predominant form of hyperten-\nsion in older persons.S10.3.1-7,S10.3.1-8 RCTs have clearly dem-\nonstrated that BP lowering in isolated systolic hypertension (defined as SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg with variable DBP ≤ 90, ≤95, \nor ≤110 mm Hg) is effective in reducing the risk of fatal and \nnonfatal stroke (primary outcome), cardiovascular events, and death.\nS10.3.1-9–S10.3.1-12\nCross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiologic studies \nin older adults have raised questions about the benefits of more intensive antihypertensive treatment and the relation-\nship between BP lowering and risk of falls.\nS10.3.1-13 Treatment \nof elevated BP in older persons is challenging because of \na high degree of heterogeneity in comorbidity, as well as \npoly-pharmacy, frailty, cognitive impairment, and variable \nlife expectancy. However, over the past 3 decades, RCTs \nof antihypertensive therapy have included large numbers \nof older persons, and in every instance, including when the \nSBP treatment goal was <120 mm Hg, more intensive treat-\nment has safely reduced the risk of CVD for persons over \nthe ages of 65, 75, and 80 years.S10.3.1-1,S10.3.1-14 Both HYVET \n(Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial) and SPRINT included those who were frail but still living independently \nin the community,\nS10.3.1-1,S10.3.1-14 and both were stopped early \nfor benefit (HYVET after 1.8 years and SPRINT after 3.26 years). In fact, BP-lowering therapy is one of the few inter -\nventions shown to reduce mortality risk in frail older indi-\nviduals. RCTs in noninstitutionalized community-dwelling \nolder persons have also demonstrated that improved BP con-trol does not exacerbate orthostatic hypotension and has no \nadverse impact on risk of injurious falls.\nS10.3.1-1,S10.3.1-15,S10.3.1-16 It \nshould be noted, however, that SPRINT excluded those with \nlow (<110 mm Hg) standing BP on study entry. Older persons need to be carefully monitored for orthostatic hypotension \nduring treatment. Intensive BP control increases the risk of \nacute kidney injury, but this is no different from the risk seen in younger adults.\nS10.3.1-1 In summary, despite the complexity \nof management in caring for older persons with hypertension, RCTs have demonstrated that in many community-dwelling older adults, even adults >80 years of age, BP-lowering goals \nduring antihypertensive treatment need not differ from those \nselected for persons <65 years of age.\nS10.3.1-17 Importantly, no \nrandomized trial of BP lowering in persons >65 years of age \nhas ever shown harm or less benefit for older versus younger \nadults. However, clinicians should implement careful titra-\ntion of BP lowering and monitoring in persons with high \ncomorbidity burden; large RCTs have excluded older persons at any age who live in nursing homes, as well as those with \nprevalent dementia and advanced HF.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. We recommend ASCVD risk assessment in all adults \nwith hypertension, including older persons. As a mat-\nter of convenience, however, it can be assumed that the \nvast majority of older adults have a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10%, placing them in the high risk category that \nrequires initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy at BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg (see",

Large RCTs using medications to re-\nduce hypertension-related CVD risk with a mean fol-\nlow-up of ≥2 years have now included a large number \nof adults ≥65 years of age. These trials have enrolled a broad range of ages ≥65 years, including persons in their 90s and even 100s, as well as those with mild-to-mod-erate frailty but who were ambulatory and able to travel to a treatment clinic. In these patients, RCTs have shown that BP lowering decreased CVD morbidity and mortali-\nty but did not increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension \nor falls.\nS10.3.1-1,S10.3.1-15,S10.3.1-16 Analysis of the NHANES \n(2011–2014) data set indicates that 88% of US adults (98% men and 80% women) ≥65 years old have a 10-\nyear predicted ASCVD risk ≥10% or have a history of CVD (CHD, stroke, or HF).

Initiation of antihypertensive therapy with 2 agents should be un-dertaken cautiously in older persons, and they need to be monitored carefully for orthostatic hypotension and history of falls. In SPRINT, the benefit was for an SBP goal of <120 mm Hg. Older persons may pres-\nent with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension associated \nwith supine hypertension. This is particularly common in Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative dis-orders. For management of this problem, the reader is referred to the recommendations of a 2017 consensus panel.\nS10.3.1-18\n2. Patients with prevalent and frequent falls, advanced cog-nitive impairment, and multiple comorbidities may be at risk of adverse outcomes with intensive BP lowering, especially when they require multiple BP-lowering medi-cations. Older persons in this category typically reside in \nnursing homes and assisting living facilities, are unable to \nlive independently in the community, and have not been represented in RCTs.\n10.3.2. Children and Adolescents\nPediatric guidelines are available from other  \norganizations.\nS10.3.2-1,S10.3.2-2 The 2011 report updates the 2004 \nreport for publications through 2008 (antihypertensive medi-\ncation trials, normative data on pediatric BP) but is otherwise \nunchanged. In the 2011 guideline,S10.3.2-3 BP was stratified into \nnormal, prehypertension (90th percentile to 95th percentile), \nstage 1 hypertension (95th percentile to >99th percentile), and \nstage 2 hypertension (above stage 1) by using age-, sex-, and \nheight-based tables beginning at 1 year of age, which were \nbased on the distribution of BP in >60 000 healthy children in \nvarious population-based studies.S10.3.2-1 These definitions were \ndesigned to be analogous to definitions in the extant JNC 7 \nreport; for older adolescents (≥14 years), the JNC 7 thresh-\nolds generally apply.S10.3.2-4 Treatment recommendations are \nbased on hypertension severity, published short-term clinical \ntrials of antihypertensive treatment, age, coexisting CVD risk \nfactors, and risk stratification by presence of LVH on echo-cardiogram. The treatment goal is to achieve BP <90th per -\ncentile. New tables for ambulatory BP distribution in children have been developed. A classification of BP that is based on these ambulatory BP results has been proposed.\nS10.3.2-5,S10.3.2-6 A \nnew pediatric BP guideline was published in late 2017.S10.3.2-711. Other Considerations\n11.1. Resistant Hypertension\nThe diagnosis of resistant hypertension is made when a patient \ntakes 3 antihypertensive medications with complementary \nmechanisms of action (a diuretic should be 1 component) but \ndoes not achieve control or when BP control is achieved but \nrequires ≥4 medications.S11.1-1 On the basis of the previous \ncutoff of 140/90 mm Hg, the prevalence of resistant hyperten-sion is approximately 13% in the adult population.\nS11.1-2,S11.1-3 \nMultiple single-cohort studies have indicated that common risk factors for resistant hypertension include older age, obesity, \nCKD, black race, and DM. Estimates suggest the prevalence would be about 4% higher with the newly recommended con-\ntrol target of <130/80 mm Hg (subject to validation in future \nstudy). The prognosis of resistant hypertension (by the previ-ous definition),\nS11.1-1 compared with the prognosis of those who \nmore readily achieve control, has not been fully ascertained; \nhowever, risk of MI, stroke, ESRD, and death in adults with \nresistant hypertension and CHD may be 2- to 6-fold higher than \nin hypertensive adults without resistant hypertension.S11.1-4–S11.1-6 \nThe evaluation of resistant hypertension involves consideration of many patient characteristics, pseudoresistance (BP technique, \nwhite coat hypertension, and medication compliance), and screen-ing for secondary causes of hypertension (Figure 10;",

The term “refractory hypertension” has been used to \nrefer to an extreme phenotype of antihypertensive treatment fail-\nure, defined as failure to control BP despite use of at least 5 anti-\nhypertensive agents of different classes, including a long-acting thiazide-type diuretic, such as chlorthalidone, and a mineralocor -\nticoid receptor antagonist, such as spironolactone.\nS11.1-7 The \nprevalence of refractory hypertension is low; patients with \nrefractory hypertension experience high rates of CVD compli-\ncations, including LVH, HF, and stroke.\nTreatment of resistant hypertension involves improv-\ning medication adherence, improving detection and correc-tion of secondary hypertension, and addressing other patient \ncharacteristics.\nS11.1-8–S11.1-10 Pharmacological therapy with com-\nbinations of medications with complementary mechanisms of action provides an empirical approach that enhances BP control \nwhile mitigating untoward effects of potent vasodilators (eg, \nfluid retention and reflex tachycardia). CCBs, inhibitors of RAS, \nand chlorthalidone comprise a common 3-drug regimen.\nS11.1-11 \nConsiderable evidence indicates that the addition of spironolac-\ntone to multidrug regimens provides substantial BP reductionS11.1-12 \nwhen compared with placebo. Substantial data also demonstrate the advantage of spironolactone as compared with other active  \ndrugs.\nS11.1-8,S11.1-13–S11.1-15 In particular, the recent PATHWAY-2 \n(Optimum Treatment for Drug-Resistant Hypertension) RCT demonstrated the superiority of spironolactone over alpha and beta \nblockers.\nS11.1-13 There is also clinical trial evidence that the addition \nof hydralazine or minoxidil is effective in achieving BP control in patients resistant to usual combination therapy.\nS11.1-8,S11.1-12–S11.1-16 \nThe dosing of multidrug regimens, occasionally including night-\ntime dosing, may be best optimized by hypertension specialists.\nSeveral studies have investigated devices that interrupt \nsympathetic nerve activity (carotid baroreceptor pacing and catheter ablation of renal sympathetic nerves); how-\never, these studies have not provided sufficient evidence to \nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nWhelton et al  2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline  e65\nrecommend the use of these device in managing resistant  \nhypertension.S11.1-8–S11.1-10 In particular, 2 RCTS of renal sympa-\nthetic nerve ablation have been negative.S11.1-8,S11.1-9\n11.2.

There is no RCT evidence that antihypertensive drugs \nreduce morbidity or mortality in patients with hyper -\ntensive emergencies.S11.2-8 However, from clinical expe-\nrience, it is highly likely that antihypertensive therapy \nis an overall benefit in a hypertensive emergency.S11.2-9 \nThere is also no high-quality RCT evidence to inform clinicians as to which first-line antihypertensive drug class provides more benefit than harm in hypertensive \nemergencies.\nS11.2-8 This lack of evidence is related to the \nsmall size of trials, the lack of long-term follow-up, and \nfailure to report outcomes. However, 2 trials have dem-\nonstrated that nicardipine may be better than labetalol \nin achieving the short-term BP target.S11.2-1,S11.2-10–S11.2-12 \nSeveral antihypertensive agents in various pharmacologi-cal classes are available for the treatment of hypertensive \nFigure 11.

Because autoregulation of tis-\nsue perfusion is disturbed in hypertensive emergencies, continuous infusion of short-acting titratable antihyper -\ntensive agents is often preferable to prevent further target \norgan damage.\nS11.2-5,S11.2-6 The selection of an antihyper -\ntensive agent should be based on the drug’s pharmacol-\nogy, pathophysiological factors underlying the patient’s hypertension (as well as they can be rapidly determined), degree of progression of target organ damage, the de-sirable rate of BP decline, and the presence of comor -\nbidities (Table 20). The therapeutic goal is to minimize target organ damage safely by rapid recognition of the \nproblem and early initiation of appropriate antihyperten-\nsive treatment.\n2. Compelling conditions requiring rapid lowering of SBP, usually to <140 mm Hg, in the first hour of treatment Table 19.  Intravenous Antihypertensive Drugs for Treatment of Hypertensive Emergencies\nClass Drug(s) Usual Dose Range Comments\nCCB—\ndihydropyridinesNicardipine Initial 5 mg/h, increasing every 5 min by 2.5 mg/h to maximum 15 mg/h.Contraindicated in advanced aortic stenosis; no dose adjustment needed for elderly.\nClevidipine Initial 1–2 mg/h, doubling every 90 s until BP approaches target, then increasing by less than double every 5–10 min; maximum dose 32 mg/h; maximum duration 72 h.Contraindicated in patients with soybean, soy product, egg, and egg product allergy and in patients with defective lipid metabolism (eg, pathological hyperlipidemia, lipoid nephrosis or acute pancreatitis). Use low-end dose range for elderly patients.\nVasodilators—Nitric-oxide dependentSodium \nnitroprussideInitial 0.3–0.5 mcg/kg/min; increase in increments of 0.5 mcg/kg/min to achieve BP target; maximum dose 10 mcg/kg/min; duration of treatment as short as possible. For infusion rates ≥ 4–10 mcg/kg/min or \nduration >30 min, thiosulfate can be coadministered to prevent cyanide toxicity.Intra-arterial BP monitoring recommended to prevent “overshoot.” Lower dosing adjustment required for elderly. Tachyphylaxis common with extended use.\nCyanide toxicity with prolonged use can result in \nirreversible neurological changes and cardiac arrest.\nNitroglycerin Initial 5 mcg/min; increase in increments of 5 mcg/min every 3–5 min to a maximum of 20 mcg/min.Use only in patients with acute coronary syndrome and/or acute pulmonary edema. Do not use in volume-depleted patients.\nVasodilators—direct Hydralazine Initial 10 mg via slow IV infusion (maximum initial dose 20 mg); repeat every 4–6 h as needed.BP begins to decrease within 10–30 min, and the fall lasts 2–4 h. Unpredictability of response and prolonged duration of action do not make hydralazine a desirable first-line agent for acute treatment in most patients.\nAdrenergic blockers—beta\n1 \nreceptor selective antagonistEsmolol Loading dose 500–1000 mcg/kg/min over 1 min followed by a 50-mcg/kg/min infusion. For additional dosing, the bolus dose is repeated and the infusion increased in 50-mcg/kg/min increments as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg/kg/min.Contraindicated in patients with concurrent beta-blocker therapy, bradycardia, or decompensated HF.\nMonitor for bradycardia.May worsen HF.Higher doses may block beta\n2 receptors and impact lung \nfunction in reactive airway disease.\nAdrenergic \nblockers—combined alpha\n1 and \nnonselective beta receptor antagonistLabetalol Initial 0.3–1.0-mg/kg dose (maximum 20 mg) slow IV injection every 10 min or 0.4–1.0-mg/kg/h IV infusion up to 3 mg/kg/h. Adjust rate up to total cumulative dose of 300 mg. This dose can be repeated every 4–6 h.Contraindicated in reactive airways disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Especially useful in hyperadrenergic syndromes. May worsen HF and should not be given in patients with second- or third-degree heart block or bradycardia.\nAdrenergic blockers—nonselective alpha receptor antagonistPhentolamine IV bolus dose 5 mg. Additional bolus doses every 10 min as needed to lower BP to target.Used in hypertensive emergencies induced by catecholamine excess (pheochromocytoma, interactions between monamine oxidase inhibitors and other drugs or food, cocaine toxicity, amphetamine overdose, or clonidine withdrawal).\nDopamine\n1-receptor \nselective agonistFenoldopam Initial 0.1–0.3 mcg/kg/min; may be increased in increments of 0.05–0.1 mcg/kg/min every 15 min until target BP is reached. Maximum infusion rate 1.6 mcg/kg/min.Contraindicated in patients at risk of increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma) or intracranial pressure and those with sulfite allergy.\nACE inhibitor Enalaprilat Initial 1.25 mg over a 5-min period. Doses can be increased up to 5 mg every 6 h as needed to achieve BP target.Contraindicated in pregnancy and should not be used in acute MI or bilateral renal artery stenosis.\nMainly useful in hypertensive emergencies associated with \nhigh plasma renin activity.\nDose not easily adjusted.\nRelatively slow onset of action (15 min) and unpredictability \nof BP response.\nBP indicates blood pressure; CCB, calcium channel blocker; HF, heart failure; IV, intravenous; and MI, myocardial infarction.\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\ne68  Hypertension  June 2018\ninclude aortic dissection, severe preeclampsia or eclamp-\nsia, and pheochromocytoma with hypertensive crisis.\n3. There is no RCT evidence comparing different strategies to reduce BP, except in patients with ICH.\nS11.2-9,S11.2-13 Neither \nis there RCT evidence to suggest how rapidly or how much \nBP should be lowered in a hypertensive emergency.S11.2-9 \nHowever, clinical experience indicates that excessive re-duction of BP may cause or contribute to renal, cerebral, \nor coronary ischemia and should be avoided. Thus, com-\nprehensive dosing of intravenous or even oral antihyper -\ntensive agents to rapidly lower BP is not without risk. Oral loading doses of antihypertensive agents can engender \ncumulative effects, causing hypotension after discharge from the emergency department or clinic.\n11.3. Cognitive Decline and Dementia\nRecommendation for Prevention of Cognitive Decline and \nDementia\nReferences that support the recommendation are \nsummarized in Online Data Supplement 56.\nCOR LOE Recommendation\nIIa B-R1.

However, \nthe anticipated results from SPRINT, the first ad-equately powered RCT to test whether intensive BP control reduces dementia, may help clarify this issue in the near future.\n11.4. Sexual Dysfunction and Hypertension\nAn association among sexual dysfunction, atherosclerosis, \nand hypertension can be constructed from several epidemi-ology surveys, clinical trials, and cohort studies. Although these data converge to suggest that endothelial dysfunc-tion is a common denominator, the story is incomplete. Sexual dysfunction represents several domains in desire or interest, as well as physical limitations such as erectile \ndysfunction. In addition, beta blockers, mineralocorticoid \nreceptor antagonists, and other antihypertensive drugs can \nhave negative effects on libido and erectile function. There \nare emerging data on the association between erectile dys-\nfunction and CVD compared with other domains of sexual \ndysfunction. Experimental and clinical studies describe a role for angiotensin II, endothelin, and hydrogen sulfide on cavernous tissue function.\nS11.4-1 Many of the signaling path-\nways for the increased production of oxidative stress and the subsequent deleterious effects of oxidative stress on vascular tissue have been described. Accordingly, it is rea-sonable to suggest that hypertension might lead to vascu-\nlar changes that cause erectile dysfunction but, conversely, \nerectile dysfunction may be part of the causal pathway to \nCVD.\nS11.4-1 Although there is insufficient evidence to rec-\nommend screening for CVD risk factors in all men with erectile dysfunction, it has been reported as a sole precur -\nsor for CVD in men.\nS11.4-2–S11.4-6\nWith the introduction of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibi-\ntors, which can be coadministered with antihypertensive medications, there is now effective therapy for erectile dysfunction that has implications for systemic vascular disease.\nS11.4-7 These drugs have additive effects on lowering \nBP and are recommended as a primary therapy for pulmonary \nhypertension.S11.4-8 Although data are available to suggest that \nsome antihypertensive medications affect erectile dysfunc-tion more than others, the use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibi-\ntors make drug class distinctions for erectile dysfunction less \nrelevant.\nS11.4-9 The long-term safety and efficacy of chronic \nadministration of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors for the mit-igation of CVD has yet to be determined and represents an \nimportant knowledge gap.\n11.5.

In patients with hypertension undergoing \nmajor surgery who have been on beta blockers chronically, beta blockers should be continued.\nS11.5-1–S11.5-7\nIIa C-EO2. In patients with hypertension undergoing planned elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue medical therapy for hypertension until surgery.\nIIb B-NR3. In patients with hypertension undergoing major surgery, discontinuation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs perioperatively may be considered.\nS11.5-8–S11.5-10\nIIb C-LD4. In patients with planned elective major surgery and SBP of 180 mm Hg or higher \nor DBP of 110 mm Hg or higher, deferring \nsurgery may be considered.\nS11.5-11,S11.5-12\nIII: Harm B-NR5. For patients undergoing surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of beta blockers or clonidine is potentially harmful.\nS11.5-2,S11.5-13\nIII: Harm B-NR6. Beta blockers should not be started on the day of surgery in beta blocker–naïve patients.\nS11.5-14\nIntraoperative\nI C-EO7. Patients with intraoperative  \nhypertension should be managed with intravenous medications (Table 19) until such time as oral medications can be resumed.\nSynopsis\nHypertension in the perioperative period increases the risk \nof CVD, cerebrovascular events, and bleeding.S11.5-15,S11.5-16 \nAs many as 25% of patients who undergo major noncar -\ndiac surgeryS11.5-17 and 80% of patients who have cardiac \nsurgery experience perioperative hypertension.S11.5-16,S11.5-18 \nIn general, the level of risk is related to the severity of the hypertension.\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\ne70  Hypertension  June 2018\nNo high-quality RCTs were identified relating to the \ntreatment of hypertension in patients undergoing major \nsurgical procedures. One analysis evaluated data from 3 \nprospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-comparison studies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and concluded that clevidipine is a safe and effective treatment for acute \nhypertension in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nS11.5-19 \nAnother systematic review and meta-analysis, including 4 \nstudies, concluded that clevidipine is more effective than other antihypertensive drugs in the management of periop-erative hypertension without adverse events.\nS11.5-20 Several \ngeneral strategies and principles based on experience and \nobservation are recommended for this section. In the man-\nagement of patients with perioperative hypertension, it is \nimportant to assess other potential contributing factors, such \nas volume status, pain control, oxygenation, and bladder \ndistention, when the use of pharmacological therapy to con-trol BP is under consideration. Uncontrolled hypertension \nis associated with increased perioperative and postopera-\ntive complications. Certain medications (eg, beta blockers, clonidine) may be associated with rebound hypertension if discontinued abruptly.\nS11.5-13 Therefore, several general strat-\negies and principles based on experience and observation are \nrecommended for this section.\nThese recommendations for beta blockers, ACE inhibi-\ntors, and ARBs are generally consistent with the “2014 \nACC/AHA Guideline on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management of Patients Undergoing \nNoncardiac Surgery” and are provided to assist in the man-\nagement of patients undergoing major noncardiac surgical procedures.\nS11.5-21\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. If well tolerated, beta blockers should be continued in \npatients who are currently receiving them for longitu-dinal reasons, particularly when longitudinal treatment is provided according to GDMT, such as for MI.\nS11.5-22 \nMultiple observational studies support the benefits of continuing beta blockers in patients who are undergo-ing surgery and who are on these agents for longitudinal indications.\nS11.5-1–S11.5-7\n2. In the absence of conclusive RCTs, the expert opinion of this writing committee is that control of BP to lev-els recommended by the present guideline (BP <130/80 mm Hg) or other target levels specified for a particular individual is reasonable before undertaking major elec-tive procedures in either the inpatient or outpatient set-ting. If the patient is unable to take oral medications, it is reasonable to use intravenous medications (Table 19) as necessary to control BP. Special consideration of paren-teral therapy usually occurs for patients taking clonidine or beta blockers because of the risk of stopping these medications acutely. Withdrawal syndromes, accompa-nied by sympathetic discharge and acute hypertension, can occur on cessation of these agents.\nS11.5-13\n3. Data on the potential risk and benefit of ACE inhibi-\ntors in the perioperative setting are limited to observa-\ntional analyses, and this area is controversial. Recent evidence from a large cohort study demonstrates that \npatients who stopped their ACE inhibitors or ARBs 24 \nhours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to suf-fer the primary composite outcome (all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury) and intraoperative hypo-tension than were those continuing these medications until surgery.\nS11.5-10\n4. JNC 6S11.5-23 noted conflicting evidence for patients with \nDBP >110 mm Hg and recommended delay of surgery for gradual reduction in DBP before proceeding with surgery. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 30 observational studies, preoperative hypertension \nwas associated with a 35% increase in cardiovascular \ncomplications.\nS11.5-12 An increase in complications, in-\ncluding dysrhythmias, myocardial ischemia or infarc-\ntion, neurological complications, and renal failure, \nhas been reported in patients with DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg \nimmediately before surgery.S11.5-24 In contrast, patients \nwith DBP <110 mm Hg do not appear to be at signifi-\ncantly increased risk.S11.5-25 The relationship of systolic \nhypertension to surgical risk is less certain. Among \npatients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, increased risk of postoperative hypertension and neurologi-cal defects were observed,\nS11.5-26 and an increased risk \nof CVD morbidity after coronary artery bypass graft surgery has been observed in patients with isolated systolic hypertension.\nS11.5-27 During induction of an-\nesthesia for surgery, sympathetic action can result in a 20– to 30–mm Hg increase in BP and a 15- to 20-\nbpm increase in heart rate among patients with normal  \nBP.\nS11.5-24 Exaggerated responses may occur in patients \nwith poorly treated or untreated hypertension by as \nmuch as 90 mm Hg and 40 bpm.S11.5-24 With further \nanesthesia, the accompanying inhibition of the sympa-\nthetic nervous system and loss of baroreceptor control \nmay result in intraoperative hypotension. Lability in BP appears more likely in patients with poorly controlled hypertension,\nS11.5-25 whereas studies have observed that \npatients with controlled hypertension respond similarly to those who are normotensive.\nS11.5-28 Early work indicated \nthat patients with severe hypertension (SBP >210 mm Hg and DBP >105 mm Hg) had exaggerated responses in \nBP during the induction of anesthesia.\nS11.5-28\n5. Although few studies describe risks of withdrawing \nbeta blockers in the perioperative time period,S11.5-2,S11.5-5 \nlongstanding evidence from other settings suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term beta blockers is harmful.\nS11.5-29–S11.5-31 There are fewer data to describe \nwhether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative use of \nbeta blockers, followed by rapid discontinuation, is \nharmful.S11.5-5,S11.5-14,S11.5-21,S11.5-30\n6. The 2014 ACC/AHA perioperative guideline specifically \nrecommends against starting beta blockers on the day of \nsurgery in beta-blocker–naive patients,S11.5-5,S11.5-21,S11.5-30  \nparticularly at high initial doses, in long-acting \nform, and if there are no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events. Data from the POISE (Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation) study demonstrate \nthe risk of initiating long-acting beta blockers on the day \nof surgery.\nS11.5-14\nDownloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on February 21, 2026\n\nWhelton et al  2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline  e71\n7. Several antihypertensive agents in a variety of pharmaco-\nlogical classes are available for the treatment of hyperten-\nsive emergencies (Table 19).\n12. Strategies to Improve Hypertension \nTreatment and Control\nIn addition to promoting pharmacological and nonpharmaco-\nlogical treatment adherence in individual patients with hyper -\ntension, several population-based systems approaches can play an important role in treatment goals.\n12.1. Adherence Strategies for Treatment  \nof Hypertension\nTherapeutic nonadherence (not following recommended medical or health advice, including failure to “persist” with \nmedications and recommended lifestyle modifications) is a major contributor to poor control of hypertension and a \nkey barrier to reducing CVD deaths. Adherence rates vary substantially in different populations and, in general, are lower for lifestyle change and more behaviorally demanding \nregimens.\n12.1.1. Antihypertensive Medication Adherence Strategies\nRecommendations for Antihypertensive Medication \nAdherence Strategies\nReferences that support recommendations are summarized \nin Online Data Supplements 59 and 60.\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nI B-R1. In adults with hypertension, dosing of \nantihypertensive medication once daily rather than multiple times daily is beneficial to improve adherence.\nS12.1.1-1–S12.1.1-3\nIIa B-NR2. Use of combination pills rather than free individual components can be useful to improve adherence to antihypertensive therapy.\nS12.1.1-4–S12.1.1-7\nSynopsis\nUp to 25% of patients do not fill their initial prescription for \nantihypertensive therapy.S12.1.1-8–S12.1.1-10 During the first year of \ntreatment, the average patient has possession of antihyperten-sive medications only 50% of the time, and only 1 in 5 patients has sufficiently high adherence to achieve the benefits observed \nin clinical trials.\nS12.1.1-11,S12.1.1-12\nFactors contributing to poor adherence are myriad, com-\nplex, and multilevel.S12.1.1-11,S12.1.1-13,S12.1.1-14 Therefore, solu-\ntions to improve adherence may be introduced at patient, \nprovider, and healthcare system levels.S12.1.1-13,S12.1.1-15,S12.1.1-16 \nSeveral systematic reviews and meta-analyses have assessed the impact of interventions on adherence to antihyperten-\nsive medications, including modification of antihypertensive \ntherapy.\nS12.1.1-1–S12.1.1-7,S12.1.1-11,S12.1.1-15,S12.1.1-16 No single inter -\nvention is uniquely effective, and a sustained, coordinated effort that targets all barriers to adherence in an individual \nis likely to be the most effective approach. See Online Data Supplement F for barriers to medication adherence and the \nmost successful interventions.\nThe creation of an encouraging, blame-free environment \nin which patients are recognized for achieving treatment goals and given “permission” to answer questions related to their \ntreatment honestly is essential to identify and address nonad-\nherence. Patient medication adherence assessment tools\nS12.1.1-17 \nare presented in Online Data Supplement A. Members of \nthe hypertension care team may use these self-report tools \nin a nonthreatening fashion to identify barriers and facilitate behaviors associated with improved adherence to antihyper -\ntensive medications. Use of more objective methods (eg, pill counts, data on medication refills) to assess adherence along \nwith self-report methods is optimal.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Remembering to take medication is often challenging, \nparticularly for regimens that must be dosed several \ntimes daily. Taking medications several times through-\nout the day requires greater attention to scheduling, as well as additional issues such as transportation or stor -\nage, which can be challenging for some patients. The impact of once-daily dosing of antihypertensive drugs versus dosing multiple times daily has been evaluated \nin several meta-analyses.\nS12.1.1-1–S12.1.1-3 Medication ad-\nherence was greatest with once-daily dosing (range 71% to 94%) and declined as dosing frequency \nincreased.\nS12.1.1-1,S12.1.1-2\n2. Assessment and possible modification of drug therapy regimens can improve suboptimal adherence. Simplifying \nmedication regimens, either by less frequent dosing (ie, \nonce daily versus multiple times daily) or use of com-bination drug therapy, improves adherence. Available \nfixed-dose combination drug therapy is listed in Online \nData Supplement D.\n12.1.2.

Most individuals have clear expectations about what a new lifestyle will provide; if their experiences do not match these expectations, they will be dissatisfied and less moti-\nvated to maintain a lifestyle change, particularly in envi-\nronments that do not support healthy choices. Other factors \nthat may influence adoption and maintenance of new physi-\ncal activity or dietary behaviors include age, sex, baseline health status, and body mass index, as well as the presence of comorbid conditions and depression, which negatively affect \nadherence to most lifestyle change regimens.\nS12.1.2-1 Primary \nstrategies include cognitive-behavioral strategies for pro-\nmoting behavior change, intervention processes and delivery strategies, and addressing cultural and social context vari-ables that influence behavioral change.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. It is crucial to translate and implement into practice \nthe most effective evidence-based strategies for ad-herence to nonpharmacological treatment for hyper -\ntension. Both adoption and maintenance of new CVD \nrisk-reducing behaviors pose challenges for many in-\ndividuals. Success requires consideration of race, eth-nicity, and socioeconomic status, as well as individual, provider, and environmental factors that may influence the design of such interventions.\nS12.1.2-1 High-quality evi-\ndence has shown that even modest sustained lifestyle changes can substantially reduce CVD morbidity and mortality.\nS12.1.2-1 Because many beneficial effects of \nlifestyle changes accrue over time, long-term adher -\nence maximizes individual and population benefits. Interventions targeting sodium restriction, other dietary patterns, weight reduction, and new physical activity \nhabits often result in impressive rates of initial behavior \nchanges but frequently are not translated into long-term behavioral maintenance.\n12.1.3.

Health system financing strategies (eg, insurance coverage and copayment benefit design) can be useful in facilitating improved medication adherence and BP control in patients with hypertension.\nS12.5-4\nSynopsis\nWith the evolution of the US health system to reward “value \nover volume,” payment systems have focused on financial \nincentives to improve quality of care. Use of performance \nmeasures promulgated by national organizations, govern-\nmental payers, and commercial payers have fostered greater \nattention to control of high BP among healthcare providers and their patients. These performance measures have formed \nthe basis for determining financial incentives for pay for \nperformance initiatives, commercial insurer “pay-for-value” \ncontracts, and the Medicare Shared Savings Programs devel-\noped by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \nInnovation for Accountable Care Organizations. In addi-\ntion, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has developed The Million Hearts: Cardiovascular Disease \nRisk Reduction Model, which is an RCT designed to iden-\ntify and test scalable models of care delivery that reduce  \nCVD risk.\nS12.5-5\nGreater attention is being paid to the influence of health \ninsurance coverage and benefit designs focused on reducing \npatient copayments for antihypertensive medications.\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Moderate-quality evidence with mixed results sug-\ngests that population-based payment incentive pro-grams can play an important role in achieving better BP \ncontrol.\nS12.5-1–S12.5-3\n2. Reduced copayments for health care, including for medi-\ncations, and improved outcomes of hypertension care have been identified in several US studies and in single \nstudies in Finland, Israel, and Brazil.\nS12.5-4 This is con-\nsistent with other evidence on how copayments reduce \nuptake of care and has implications for policy makers, \nparticularly because the balance of evidence does not \nsuggest that reducing medication copayments leads to an increase in overall healthcare expenditure.\n13.

Health Literacy\nCommunicating alternative behaviors that support self-  \nmanagement of healthy BP in addition to medication adher -\nence is important. This should be done both verbally and in \nwriting. Today, mobile phones have a recording option. For patients with mobile phones, the phone can be used to inform \npatients and family members of medical instructions after \nthe doctor’s visit as an additional level of communication. Inclusion of a family member or friend that can help interpret \nand encourage self-management treatment goals is suggested \nwhen appropriate. Examples of needed communication for alternative behaviors include a specific regimen relating to physical activity; a specific sodium-reduced meal plan indi-\ncating selections for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; lifestyle \nrecommendations relating to sleep, rest, and relaxation; and finally, suggestions and alternatives to environmental barri-\ners, such as barriers that prevent healthy food shopping or \nlimit reliable transportation to and from appointments with health providers and pharmacy visits.\n13.2. Access to Health Insurance and Medication \nAssistance Plans\nHealth insurance and medication plan assistance for patients is \nespecially important to improving access to and affordability \nof medical care and BP medications. Learning how the patient \nfinancially supports and budgets for his or her medical care and medications offers the opportunity to share additional insight relating to cost reductions, including restructured payment \nplans. Ideally, this would improve the patient’s compliance \nwith medication adherence and treatment goals.\n13.3. Social and Community Services\nHealth care can be strengthened through local partner -\nships. Hypertensive patients, particularly patients with lower incomes, have more opportunity to achieve treatment goals with the assistance of strong local partnerships.

Summary of BP Thresholds and Goals  \nfor Pharmacological Therapy\nSeveral different BP thresholds and goals for the long-term treatment of hypertension with pharmacological therapy are recommended in this guideline. To provide a quick reference for practicing clinicians, these are summarized for hyperten-\nsive patients in general and for those with specific comorbidi-\nties in Table 23.\n15. Evidence Gaps and Future Directions\nIn the present guideline, the writing committee was able to call on the large body of literature on BP and hypertension to make strong recommendations across a broad range of medical con-ditions. Nonetheless, significant gaps in knowledge exist.\nImportantly, there are areas where epidemiological and \nnatural history studies suggest that hypertension prevention or earlier treatment of hypertension might substantially improve outcomes, but clinical trials are lacking to provide guidance. The combination of epidemiological data showing a graded relationship between BP and outcomes, particularly above a BP of 120/80 mm Hg, and the results of the SPRINT trial \nshowing benefit of more comprehensive treatment to a target BP of <120/80 mm Hg, suggests that a lifelong BP below that level will substantially lower CVD and CKD incidence. This is especially the case for younger individuals, those with DM, and those with high lifetime CVD risk based on the presence of multiple risk factors, including high BP. If hard, cardiovascular outcome clinical trials remain the sole driver of evidence-based guidelines, then determining the full benefit of earlier interven-tion may not be possible because of the cost and length of time \nneeded for intervention. Outcomes may be different if antihy-\npertensive treatment is initiated earlier in the natural history of CVD. DM may provide a population in whom to test this \nhypothesis. Composite outcomes that include both prevention \nof events and surrogates, such as prevention of decline in renal \nfunction or amelioration of measures of subclinical atheroscle-\nrosis, vascular stiffness, or LV structure and function, should \nbe considered. Otherwise, these younger individuals may be undertreated and experience mortality or CVD events before being old enough to enter hard outcome–driven trials such \nas SPRINT. Replication of SPRINT, especially in younger \npatients with DM and in countries where nonischemic stroke is \nthe predominant cause of CVD, is highly desirable. Likewise, \nimplementation studies that demonstrate the practicality of SPRINT-like interventions in resource-constrained practice settings are needed.\nMore information is urgently needed relating hypertensive \ntarget organ damage to CVD risk and outcomes. Should the identification of target organ damage and hypertensive heart disease prompt more aggressive BP management (ie, increase the rationale for instituting pharmacological therapy earlier or more intensively? Should all patients with hypertension be \nscreened with echocardiogram for LVH? Should echocardiog-\nraphy be repeated once LVH is noted? Is it important to docu-ment LVH regression? At present, there are no RCT data to inform guideline recommendations.\nABPM and HBPM provide enhanced ability to both diag-\nnose hypertension and monitor treatment. Although evidence \nis sufficient to recommend incorporating these tools into clini-\ncal practice, more knowledge about them is required. Areas of inquiry include closer mapping of the relationship of out-comes to ambulatory and home BP measurements, so that definitions of hypertension and hypertension severity based on Clinician follow-up, monitoring, and care coordination\n        Follow-up visits Sections 8.1.3,  \n8.3.1, 8.3.2\n Team-based care",

Reproducibility of ambulatory and home BPs \nmust be studied, and cohorts should include a broader range \nof ethnicities. Trials with entry criteria and treatment goals based on ambulatory or home BP measures should be con-\nducted, including studies of masked and white coat hyperten-\nsion. The practicality and cost of incorporating ABPM into \nEHR and routine care should be assessed. The existence of \nthese techniques should not hamper efforts to investigate ways \nto improve accuracy in the measurement of clinic BP. Further \nresearch on improving accuracy of office BP measurements, \nincluding number of measurements, training of personnel mea-\nsuring BP, and device comparisons, will help standardize care \nand thus improve outcomes. Technology for measurement of \nBP continues to evolve with the emergence of cuffless devices \nand other strategies that provide the opportunity for continuous \nnoninvasive assessment of BP. The accuracy, cost, and useful-\nness of these new technologies will need to be assessed.\nThe contemporary healthcare environment is dramatically \ndifferent from the era in which awareness of hypertension as \na risk factor and benefits of treatment were discovered. With \nthe advent of the EHR, complex calculations of CVD risk and \nrenal function can be incorporated into routine reports, and \nmany new avenues to support intervention strategies are avail-\nable to clinicians. Optimizing these approaches will require \ncontinued focused research. Recognition that simply applying \nwhat we know about BP control would have a large impact \non population health, observations on inefficiencies and \nexcessive cost in the US healthcare system, and the growth \nof information technology have led to promising studies of \nways to improve and monitor hypertension care. Results of \nthis research are reflected in this guideline, but further work is \nrequired. Examples for study include the effectiveness of mul-\ntidisciplinary healthcare teams to achieve BP treatment goals \nat lower cost, social media to maintain contact with patients, \ninformation technology to monitor outcomes and decrease \npractice variability, and incentives to providers to achieve bet-\nter outcomes for patients. A key goal of these efforts should \nbe to demonstrate reduction in healthcare disparities across \nethnicity, sex, social and economic class, and age barriers.\nMore research on the prevention of the development of \nhypertension and the benefit of lifetime low BP should be \nconducted. In this regard, elucidation of genetic expression, \nepigenetic effects, transcriptomics, and proteomics that link \ngenotypes with longitudinal databases may add consider -\nable knowledge about beneficial outcomes of lifelong lower BP, determinants of rise in BP over time, and identification \nof new treatment targets through understanding the under -\nlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Research should be directed toward the development of therapies that directly \ncounteract the mechanisms accounting for the development \nof hypertension and disease progression. Additional research \naimed at development of practical approaches to implemen-\ntation of clinical and population-based strategies to prevent \nobesity, increase physical fitness, and control excess salt and \nsugar intake could have significant public health impact. In \naddition, there are minimal, if any, data on whether treatment \nof hypertension during pregnancy mitigates risk; thus, there is a need for further research in this area, considering both \nproximate (during the pregnancy and postpartum period) and \ndistant (CVD prevention) outcomes.\nS15-1\nIn the very old, frailty and higher risk of medication side \neffects complicate treatment. Additional knowledge of the \neffects of antihypertensive treatment for patients with demen-\ntia and patients who reside in long-term-care facility settings \nis needed. The best approach to older persons who have supine \nhypertension but postural hypotension needs to be clarified.\nFurther research related to shared decision-making with \npatients and their families is needed. Examples include areas \nwhere evidence does not clearly identify one treatment or goal \nas substantially better than another, where improved patient \nknowledge (or improved provider knowledge of the patient’s \ncircumstances) might improve compliance, where reliance on \npatient collaboration improves achievement of outcomes (eg, \nHBPM, use of social media), and where there are competing health concerns (eg, older individuals with frailty).\nFinally, clinical guidelines are increasingly required to man-\nage the large body of accumulated knowledge related to diag-nosis and management of high BP. However, guidelines often \ncause controversy and confusion when competing recommen-\ndations are made by different “expert” groups or when changes in definitions, treatments, or treatment goals are introduced. Now may be the time to begin the investigation of the impact of guidelines on clinical practice, costs, and patient outcomes, \nas well as ways to facilitate communication and collaboration between different guideline-developing organizations. This \ndocument is, as its name implies, a guide.
